          The Early Days: Friendship and Fantasy Football
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my digital playground for all things fantasy football!
          My name is Alex, and my journey into this fascinating world began more than a decade ago,
          thanks to my best friend John. From our elementary school days, John and I have been inseparable,
          especially when it comes to fantasy football. Little did I know that this childhood curiosity
          would evolve into a lifelong passion.
        </p>

          The Coder's Journey: From Engineering to Computer Science
        </h2>
        <p>
          By the time I reached college, I found another passion: coding.
          Originally enrolled as an engineering major, I switched to computer science and graduated from
          Harvey Mudd College in 2022. While my academic journey included a diverse range of courses, it
          was machine learning and data science that caught my imagination. I even dabbled in personal
          projects, like a stock forecaster, to further explore these fields.

          Merging Two Worlds: Why This Blog Exists
        </h2>
        <p>
          Why combine coding and fantasy football, you ask? The answer is simple:
          I aim to blend my technical skills and love for the game to gain a competitive edge in
          fantasy football leagues. And what's more, I want to share my learnings and insights with you.
          Through this blog, I wish to dive deep into football statistics, player performances, and
          other metrics, all with the goal of revolutionizing the way we approach fantasy football.

          Achievements and Strategies: My Fantasy Football Journey
        </h2>
        <p>
          My first taste of victory came when I won a league with John, despite being a rookie in the
          fantasy football world. I owe that win to Jamaal Charles, who became my playoffs hero. My draft
          strategy has changed over the years, but my go to is picking the best player available. Value
          is king in fantasy.

          The Tools of the Trade: My Coding Contributions
        </h2>
        <p>
          While my software skills have primarily been utilized in other spheres, I've made a modest start in applying
          them to fantasy football. One such project is a small tool that fetches Average Draft Positions (ADPs) into an
          Excel sheet, making it easier for me to annotate my draft plans.

          For the Readers: What You Can Expect
        </h2>
        <p>
          As you join me on this journey, I hope you'll gain valuable insights into player valuations for
          drafts, trades, and waiver wires. And who knows? You might even pick up some machine learning
          skills along the way. My sources of inspiration range from football analysis YouTube channels to
          the ever-insightful Reddit threads, keeping me up-to-date with the latest trends in both coding and
          fantasy football.

          A Little More About Me: The Bears and Beyond
        </h2>
        <p>
          On a personal note, I'm a die-hard Chicago Bears fan, forever torn between the agony and <s>ecstasy</s>
          that comes with supporting the team. My all-time favorite players include legends like Julius Peppers
          and Brian Urlacher, with a soft spot for Matt Forte. When I'm not buried in code or glued to
          the screen for a game, you'll find me exploring other interests, usually outside somewhere.
