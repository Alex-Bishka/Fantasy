            <h1>RBs in 2022</h1>


            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>James Conner is good value for his production.</li>
                <li>Najee feels like a plodder.</li>
                <li>Swift might be very good with the Eagles. His per game numbers and efficiency numbers are
                    encouraging. Perhaps better than Sanders with that Eagles o-line.</li>
                <li>Good running backs don't need to be good runners or rather have great running stats.</li>
                <li>Jamaal Williams was really good for the Lions last year, Monty could be even better in that role.
                </li>
                <li>CMC and Ekeler are goldmines in PPR leagues. You need to get yourself a back on this level as a
                    contender.</li>
                <li>Receiving numbers correspond to success more so that rushing numbers do!</li>
                <li>Backs that get at least 4 targets a game produce well in PPR.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">Overview</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Welcome back to my 2022 player performance review by position group! This time, I'll be focusing on
                running backs.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                This write-up got a bit long, so I'll be splitting it into a couple of blogs, the first of which will
                focus on simpler analysis.
                Stay tuned for part 2, which should come out shortly.

                My data disclaimer, as always:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>I don't take into account anything related to two point conversions, partly due to
                    the randomness and small sample size but mostly because it was difficult to incorporate into the
                    data I
                    fetched</li>
                <li>The top 40 RBs I analyze are by the top 40 fantasy point totals, this is done for

            <h2 class="h2-blog">Fantasy Points</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Let's go ahead and kick off the analysis by looking at fantasy points on a season and per game basis.
                We will start by taking a look at standard scoring and then move onto PPR scoring.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h3-blog">Standard Scoring</h3>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Here we have the season total and per game numbers for fantasy points in standard scoring:
            </p>
            <div class="blog-img-container">
                <img class="multi-img" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/images/RB/Total Fantasy Points.png">
                <img class="multi-img" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/images/RB/Fantasy Points Per Game.png">
            </div>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The trend of positional scarcity continues here, as a top running back offers so much more than even
                borderline RB1 quality players.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Take for example Najee, who was the threshold for the RB1, versus Nick Chubb, who was RB5 on the season
                last year.
                Najee had 182 points, while Chubb had 254 points last year. That's a difference of 72 points.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                That's a larger difference than Najee and the threshold for the RB2 tier.
                The threshold for the RB2 tier was 140 points (McKinnon, Singletary, and Dillon tied for this).
                That's a 42 point difference between the bar for being an RB1 and an RB2.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Going even further, the difference between Najee and the RB3 threshold, which was Jonathan Taylor was 64
                points.
                So, Chubb has more value over Najee, than Najee has over the RB3 threshold - <b>positional dominance
                    makes a big difference to a fantasy team!</b>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                That being said, there isn't as much of clear tier break within the RB1 crowd when looking at fantasy
                points on a per game basis.
                Although, the top four backs - Henry, Jacobs, CMC, and Ekeler - are still more valuable than the RB1
                threshold compared to the RB1 threshold to the RB3
                threshold.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Ekeler, the lowest per game scorer of those four backs, had 15.64 points per game, while K9 (the RB12)
                had 11.73 points per game.
                That's a difference of 3.91 points per game.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Meanwhile, the difference between K9 and the RB3 threshold (Dillon) is 3.49 points per game.
                Top backs are worth it, and I would pay the price to get one to push my contending team over the edge.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Couple other things to note:
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Breece Hall is a stud! He was RB7 on a per game basis last year, with 13.71 points per game. Excited
                    to see what he can do when fully healthy.</li>
                <li>Najee's per game numbers (10.70 points per game) put him in the RB2 crowd, which isn't encouraging
                    given how unexplosive he looked last year.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            </p>


            <h3 class="h3-blog">PPR Scoring</h3>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Moving on, let's take a look at fantasy points in PPR scoring.
            </p>
            <div class="blog-img-container">
                <img class="multi-img" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/images/RB/Total Fantasy Points PPR.png">
                <img class="multi-img" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/images/RB/Fantasy Points Per Game PPR.png">
            </div>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The elite group of RB1s stretches out a bit more here, than it does in standard scoring,
                with Chubb being the last back to break the 280 point mark:
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Austin Ekeler - 372.7</li>
                <li>Christian McCaffrey - 356.4</li>
                <li>Josh Jacobs - 328.3</li>
                <li>Derrick Henry - 302.8</li>
                <li>Saquon Barkley - 284.0</li>
                <li>Nick Chubb - 281.4</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                As a result of this widened group of great running backs, the value gap isn't as wide as it is in
                standard.
                The difference between Chubb and the RB1 threshold is 55.29 points.
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Big Lenny was that threshold at RB12, and the difference between him and the RB2 threshold was 48.4
                points.
                Furthermore, the difference between Big Lenny and the RB3 threshold was 87 points.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                That being said, if we choose Henry as the cutoff - the lowest scoring back over 300 points last year -
                the value gained in having
                a dominate back becomes more similar to the situation in standard, as Henry outscored Big Lenny by 76.7
                points last year.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                So, the takeaway for me here is that elite running backs still have immense value, but they aren't as
                valuable as they would be in standard,
                which makes sense from an intuitive point of view.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Here's another representation of the two graphs above.
                I would say it serves as additional confirmation of findings in our analysis above.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Although, I will say this shows that Conner, Kamara, Najee, K9, Jamaal Williams, Swift and (maybe)
                Taylor are all on that fringe of being an RB1, at least on a per game basis.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I say maybe for Taylor, as if he is healthy, I do expect him to perform much better on a per game basis
                than what he did last year.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Also, I'm surprised by how much Conner has left in the tank. He averaged 15.39 points per game last
                year, which is in RB1 territory. Could be a great value buy for contenders this year.
            </p>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">Rushing Stats</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Let's go ahead and examine some rushing stats like yardage, carries, touchdowns and fumbles.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h3-blog">Rushing Yards</h3>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Starting with rushing season totals:
            </p>
            <div class="blog-img-container">
                <img class="multi-img" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/images/RB/Total Rushing Yards.png">
                <img class="multi-img"
                    src="/Fantasy/Analysis/images/RB/Total Fantasy Points PPR-by-Total Rushing Yards.png">
            </div>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Quite a few things catch my eye:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Big Lenny was an RB1 in spite of his putrid 668 rushing yards on the season.</li>
                <li>Mixon only had 814 rushing yards, which also feels very low for an RB1.</li>
                <li>Foreman and Pacheco overachieved relative to their RB tier, with both being RB2s in regards to
                    season total rushing yards. Makes Pacheco an interesting buy for me, but I would stay away from
                    Foreman as I am very high on Roschon.</li>
                <li>Miles Sanders had 1269 rushing yards. I'm less a believer in him, than the Eagles o-line, so I would
                    try and grab Swift for value if that's still possible.</li>
                <li>Same principal applies to the Lions o-line, Jamaal Williams had 1066 rushing yards last year.</li>
                <li>Tyler Allgeier had 1035 rushing yards. I'm excited for Bijan, but also Tyler might still have a role
                    in that offense, or on a different NFL team.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Let's move onto the per game rushing numbers:
            </p>
            <div class="blog-img-container">
                <img class="multi-img" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/images/RB/Rushing Yards Per Game.png">
                <img class="multi-img"
                    src="/Fantasy/Analysis/images/RB/Fantasy Points Per Game PPR-by-Rushing Yards Per Game.png">
            </div>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                What I find to be of note here:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Taylor shows his value here, as RB5 on the list with 78.27 rushing yards per game.</li>
                <li>Dameon Pierce also highlights his strength here as RB7, with 72.23 rushing yards per game.</li>
                <li>Big Lenny and Ekeler are far lower than their other fellow RB1s, with 41.75 and 53.82 rushing yards
                    per game respectively.</li>
                <li>These graphs really show me that rushing numbers might not be as important as I originally suspected
                    to running back value.
                    Despite that, it does seem that being under 50 yards rushing per game makes it almost impossible to
                    be an RB1 or RB2.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 class="h3-blog">Carries and Yards Per Carry</h3>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Let's go ahead and take a look at rushing attempts and carry stats:
            </p>
            <div class="blog-img-container">
                <img class="multi-img"

            </div>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Volume does seem to track with success, but only to a degree. The magic threshold for being a quality
                back seems to be around 200 carries throughout the season.
                Players with 200 plus carries and their per game numbers:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Austin Ekeler - 204 attempts | 21.92 ppg</li>
                <li>Christian McCaffrey - 244 attempts | 20.96 ppg</li>
                <li>Josh Jacobs - 340 attempts | 19.31 ppg</li>
                <li>Derrick Henry - 349 attempts | 18.93 ppg</li>

                <li>Kenneth Walker III - 228 attempts | 13.5 ppg</li>
                <li>Ezekiel Elliott - 231 attempts | 12.39 ppg</li>
                <li>David Montgomery - 201 attempts | 11.11 ppg</li>
                <li>Dameon Pierce - 220 attempts | 12.8 ppg</li>
                <li>Tyler Allgeier - 210 attempts | 9.96 ppg</li>
                <li>D'Onta Foreman - 203 attempts | 7.71 ppg</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Allgeier and Foreman are the slackers in the group above, but other than Foreman, the production is
                solid (throwing value out of the window for a second).
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The list does improve a bit in quality if you look at carries per game:

                Basically, if your back is getting at least 12 carries a game, you'll be getting at least 10 points per
                game out of them
                which is flirting with RB2 territory, in the worst case scenario.

                It's a bit harder to draw conclusions from this, as inefficient and efficient backs both produce.
                Hyper-efficient backs, which I'll call backs with more than 5 yards a carry, are valuable, but rare.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                You would ideally want a back that has high volume and elite efficiency, but outside of Chubb that
                doesn't really exist.
                Although I think you could make a case for Jacobs being close with 20 carries a game on 4.86 yards per
                carry.

                I'm struggling to find much here to connect fumbles and fantasy performance.
                Each of the running back tiers are pretty evenly split across the graph.
                So, the only thing I can say is that as long as your back doesn't get benched from fumbles, it's not a
                problem.

                Moving onto the other speciality of the running back: receiving stats.

            <h3 class="h3-blog">Receiving Yards</h3>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                We can start by examining receiving yards:
            </p>
            <div class="blog-img-container">
                <img class="multi-img" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/images/RB/Total Receiving Yards.png">

            </div>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Outside of Chubb, and to some degree Dalvin Cook, pretty much all of the RB1 tier has good receiving
                yardage output.
                This definitely surprised me, and showed me how outdated my beliefs of what makes a good back: they need
                to be at least competent receivers.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The graph on the right really hammers this home, as the tiers of running backs correlate strongly with
                receiving performance.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Additionally, CMC and Ekeler are just insane. The top five backs by receiving yards:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Christian McCaffrey - 741 receiving yards | 20.96 ppg</li>
                <li>Austin Ekeler - 722 receiving yards | 21.92 ppg</li>
                <li>Leonard Fournette - 523 receiving yards | 14.13 ppg</li>
                <li>Jerick McKinnon - 512 receiving yards | 11.55 ppg</li>
                <li>Alvin Kamara - 490 receiving yards | 14.11 ppg</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Pretty big gap between those two and the rest of the backs in the league.
            </p>

                The per game numbers definitely makes the trend a bit
                blurrier - it is slightly less clear here that receiving backs are
                productive backs (at least in regards to RB1 production).
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                That being said, the RB1s, outside of Chubb and Cook, are still dominating the receiving yard stats on a
                per game basis.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Outside of that I was surprised by Antonio Gibson creeping into the RB1 territory here, but he's not
                someone I recommend in investing in.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Additionally, RB2s and RB3s are kinda all over the place on the per game numbers as well, so receiving
                stats do seem to correlate with RB1s,
                but not so much with anyone else.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h3-blog">Targets and Receptions</h3>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The first that catches my eye is actually with the graph on the right.
                Targets to receptions are pretty much 1:1 or like <i>targets per game = receptions per game + 1</i>.
                This makes sense when giving it some thought, as running backs are likely to get dump offs,
                but it surprised me because it's different for tight ends and wide receivers.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The other thing that I noticed, is that backs with at least 4 targets a game return really good
                production:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Austin Ekeler - 21.92 ppg</li>
                <li>Christian McCaffrey - 20.96 ppg</li>
                <li>Saquon Barkley - 17.75 ppg</li>
                <li>Rhamondre Stevenson - 14.65 ppg</li>
                <li>Aaron Jones - 14.62 ppg</li>
                <li>Joe Mixon - 17.11 ppg</li>
                <li>Leonard Fournette - 14.13 ppg</li>
                <li>Alvin Kamara - 14.11 ppg</li>

            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I think it's possible to find guys every year that you think might get at least 4 targets a game and get
                them on the cheap before they produce.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Looking at the season total numbers, it seems like the number you want your back to hit is at least 60
                targets.
                The reception numbers aren't as clear, especially since some backs do a lot more with less.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Take Henry for example, back number 9 last year in total receiving yards with 398 receiving yards.
                He only had 2.06 catches on 2.56 targets a game. That's pretty crazy!
            </p>


            <h3 class="h3-blog">Touchdowns</h3>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">

                Pretty much like other positions, touchdowns are pretty variant across the board.
                Touchdowns are great for fantasy production, but hard to rely on and use to determine back quality.

                On a per game basis, it does clear up a little bit, especially if we ignore Perine.
                It seems like average 0.2 receiving touchdowns a game (or 1 touchdown every 5 games) does correlate to
                some success.

                Again, a really solid list of backs to have (minus Cook, due to the new situation).

                It's all over the place, as expected. I will say that 10 seems to be a magic number.
                You can also find some real value with that expectation, see Jamaal Williams and Jerick McKinnon.

                The list of backs with at least 10 touchdowns last year:

                    <li>Austin Ekeler - 21.92 ppg</li>

                It's probably too late to acquire these guys now, but this is why I was pretty high on Monty, and to some degree Swift.
                Both of them were replacing backs with great redzone opportunities, and both of them are better than their predecessors, in my opinion.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                For that same reason, I'm off-put by Williams and Sanders this year. I think both are in considerably worse situations, and I want to avoid them.

                I don't think much changes here for me, but it is interesting to see the per game numbers.
                I am a little surprised by Patterson, but I don't see him doing much going forward with Bijan being drafted by the Falcons.

            <h2 class="h2-blog">Summary</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I've already written enough for this one, so it's time to hit the review and call it a day:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>James Conner is good value for his production, similar to his fellow Cardinal, Ertz.</li>
                <li>Najee feels like a plodder. I would be worried about Warren.</li>
                <li>Me likey Swift's and Monty's situations.</li>
                <li>Good running backs don't need to be good runners or even have great running stats.</li>
                <li>CMC and Ekeler are guys you pay up for as a contender. They are both special.</li>
                <li>Receiving numbers correspond to success more so that rushing numbers do!</li>
                <li>Backs that get at least 4 targets a game produce really well in PPR.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                And the standards to be a RB1 are something like:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>1400 total yards - the spread doesn't matter too much, but ~300 yards receiving would be good.</li>
                <li>10 total touchdowns - again, spread doesn't matter too much.</li>
                <li>A back with at least 4 targets a game will produce.</li>
                <li>A minimum of 200 rushing attempts, but the more the merrier.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                That's all folks!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Please keep an eye out for the next part of the running back 2022 performance review,
                where I'll be looking into running back tiers via clustering.
