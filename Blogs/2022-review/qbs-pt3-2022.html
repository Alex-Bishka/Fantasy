            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Josh Allen is the best quarterback to own in fantasy football, and it's not close. An elite (fantasy) passer and one of best (fantasy) rushing quarterbacks, I don't think there's a better combo threat now and for the foreseeable future.</li>
                <li>Fields is on his own planet when it comes to running the ball. This is what makes him and quarterbacks with high rushing ceilings exciting. Can he develop an okay passing game to regularly challenge for the status of a top five fantasy quarterback?</li>
                <li>Hurts and Jackson are the best, after Fields, at producing rushing stats relevant to fantasy football.</li>
                <li>Allen and Jones round out the top 5, with Kyler Murray sneaking around.</li>

                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>I exclude anything related to two point conversions, partly due to
                        the randomness and small sample size but mostly because it was difficult to incorporate into the
                        data I fetched</li>
                    <li>The top 30 QBs I analyze are by the top 30 fantasy point totals, this is done for
                        simplicity and reusability of graphing code</li>

                <b>One final note</b> about this piece: I only will be writing about season and per game totals with three and seven tiers.
                This is because the shift from three to seven tiers does not provide much change, or information, when evaluating the quarterback rushing
                landscape. So, please enjoy the shorter piece!

                I think there are a couple of surprising names in Cluster 0.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I would have expected Dak, Rodgers, and Herbert to all be a bit better in the run game.
                They have all had better rushing seasons before 2022. Although Rodgers hasn't eclipsed over 200 rushing yards since 2018, so maybe that is a more
                historic narrative that has been stuck in my head about him. Prescott has not hit the 200 yard mark either, since 2019, but he would have last year if
                he played more than 12 games. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The rest of this picture is about what you would expect from what happened in 2022.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Fields was absolutely monstrous in the run game last year. His stat line: 160 carries for 1143 yards, to go along with 8 touchdowns.
                That would amount to 162 fantasy points, which is better production on the ground than most running backs in the NFL!
                Also, that rushing line amounts to an impressive 7.14 yards per carry!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                To put into perspective how absurd the rushing line is, Lamar was the next closest quarterback in total rushing yards with 764.
                That's a pretty bonkers advantage over the rest of the quarterback field. Especially since 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Fields is a spectacular scrambling quarterback. If only Fields could be 70% as good in the passing game, then he could seriously challenge
                Mahomes and Allen for the QB1 throne. Lamar and the rest of Cluster 1 were the only other quarterbacks with more than 450 yards rushing. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                One thing to keep in mind, Fields did have 16 fumbles last year, which led the league.
                Only three other quarterbacks had more than 10 in 2022, so that is another thing for Fields to improve upon.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I would also like to point out the rest of Cluster 1.
                Allen, Hurts, and Jones all have significant stats in the running game, which led to their success in fantasy in 2022.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Allen is the one that blows the mind for me. He was in tier 1 when performing the clustering exercise on passing stats for quarterbacks in <a href="/Blogs/qbs-pt2-2022">part 2</a>,
                and he's in tier 1 for rushing as well.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Perhaps the best fantasy quarterback to own for now and the future?

                The most interesting thing to me here is the splitting of the top tier from the previous graph into three tiers:
                Cluster 0, Cluster 4, and Cluster 5.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Now, I think it should be said that as awesome as Allen is, he gets grouped with Fields because their fumble numbers make
                them closer to each other than say Allen with Hurts or Lamar. So, take this grouping with a bit of salt. Allen is still
                an elite rushing quarterback, but to say that he is the next closest to Fields might be a little inaccurate.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                To me, Hurts is probably the next best rushing quarterback because of his touchdown opportunities with the "tush push".
                That would put him just above Allen for me.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                However, I would have to say Jackson is probably the next best rushing quarterback after Fields. Although, he might be better,
                as Jackson did have a season with 176 carries for 1206 yards and 7 touchdowns, but we haven't seen a 1000 yard plus season from
                Lamar since 2020. Injuries definitely have suppressed his season totals from 2020 on, but he still was a top 5 rushing quarterback
                last year, despite playing only 12 games.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                As a result, I think this final tiering flatters Danny Dimes. A great rushing quarterback, but, in context, I would have to put him
                at the bottom of these five guys. We'll see if he can ever do it again, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38832758/giants-qb-daniel-jones-season-ending-torn-acl">after it was confirmed that his ACL was torn</a>.

                Some changes to note here:

                    <li>Prescott jumps into the middle rushing tier (Cluster 0 in this case).</li>
                    <li>Jackson, Murray, and Mariota jump into that top tier of rushing quarterbacks on a per game basis.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                So the numbers do corroborate with my perception of Prescott the player, he can run the ball a little.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Also, this is another reason why I see Murray as a good buy low. His rankings in the passing tiers were always decent, but his rushing output
                has been pretty consistent around 400-500 yards with 3-5 touchdowns. Moreover, Murray has shown a ceiling of 800 yards and 11 touchdowns.
                Combine that with his strong passing base, and I think he could jump back into the top 10 quarterbacks on KTC.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Mariota at this point is no better than a backup quarterback, so not worth spending much time on dissecting him.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                It is good to see Jackson jump into tier one on a per game basis level. This supports the narrative that the injuries to him and the pieces
                around him led to depressed season totals.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The rest of this reflects the season totals rankings pretty well, so onward to the final graph!

                Then it's three clusters who are all contending behind him: clusters 1, 3, and 5.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Hurts (Cluster 3) is probably the next best rushing weapon, as his touchdowns per game really set him apart from the other two tiers competing for next best.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Then it's a bit of a mixed bag between Jones, Jackson, Allen, Murray and Mariota. It's probably Allen as next best rushing quarterback as 
                he's top five in rushing yards per game and tied for third in touchdowns per game. I would feel safer saying the tier below Hurts and Fields is
                Allen, Jackson and Jones, with Murray and Mariota sniffing behind them.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Considering Mariota is probably never going to reliably be a starting quarterback again, and Jones just tore his ACL, I would say the rushing landscape and quarterback
                probably looks something like Fields, then Hurts, then Allen and Jackson in the same tier, and finally Murray.
                Anthony Richardson might be able to break into this top five, but for now this would be my top five for best rushing production at the quarterback position.

            <h2 class="h2-blog">Summary</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Thanks to those for reading another 2022 analysis piece! The last one, to wrap up the season, will be this same clustering
                exercise, but on wide receivers and related receiving stats. After that, I'll be looking into some 2023 analysis by position group,
                as well as highlighting some players. I recently found a good source for advanced stats, so I will be using that data starting with
                the 2023 pieces.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The points to takeaway from this piece:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Josh Allen is the best quarterback to own in fantasy football, and it's not close. An elite (fantasy) passer and one of best (fantasy) rushing quarterbacks, I don't think there's a better combo threat now and for the foreseeable future.</li>
                <li>Fields is on his own planet when it comes to running the ball. This is what makes him and quarterbacks with high rushing ceilings exciting. Can he develop an okay passing game to regularly challenge for the status of a top five fantasy quarterback?</li>
                <li>Hurts and Jackson are the best, after Fields, at producing rushing stats relevant to fantasy football.</li>
                <li>Allen and Jones round out the top 5, with Kyler Murray sneaking around.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Looking forward to the next one!
            </p>

                A pleasure as always!
