            <h1>WRs in 2022 Part 2</h1>


            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>We are in a golden age of wide receiver talent!</li>
                <li>London is a great buy low. Has been a WR3 with some of the worst quarterback play in the NFL. It can only go up from here (I hope).</li>
                <li>Add Christian Watson to the list of buy lows. He flashed quite some ability in 2022, but injuries and quarterback concerns have depressed his value.</li>
                <li>There's a lot of good young (Wilson, Olave, Pickens, Watson, London, etc.) and old talent (Hopkins, Evans, Allen, etc.) for both rebuilders and contenders to buy.</li>
                <li>Plenty of studs at varying ages prices as well: Chase, Jefferson, Lamb, Brown, Adams, Diggs, Hill, etc.</li>
                <li>
                    Maybe Chase shouldn't be in the same tier as Jefferson? Yes, he has one of the most insane ceilings in fantasy, but his consistency is not quite at the same 
                    level as that of Jefferson. It seems Burrow is a big factor in keeping these two close in value, but does Dobbs change that?
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2-blog">Overview</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Welcome back to the final installment of the 2022 position group analysis series. This last piece will continue upon
                the first <a href="">2022 wide receiver analysis piece</a>. This time around, we will be using receiving stats - season totals and per game
                numbers - to create wide receiver tiers.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I will only be looking at receiving stats for wide receivers, as so few of them actually get carries and produce off of carries.
                Outside of Amon-Ra, Curtis Samuel, and Deebo, no one really produced on the ground last year. Something to keep in mind for those three,
                but largely discard for the rest of the wide receivers we will be taking a look at.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                As always, our goal is to find players who are undervalued so that we can acquire them and acrew more value on our rosters. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                <b>My data disclaimer, as always:</b>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>I don't take into account anything related to two point conversions, partly due to
                    the randomness and small sample size but mostly because it was difficult to incorporate into the
                    data I
                    fetched</li>
                <li>The top 48 WRs I analyze are by the top 48 fantasy point totals, this is done for
                    simplicity and reusability of graphing code</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The receiving stats that we will evaluate wide receivers by are:
                "Receiving Yards", "Receptions", "Receiving TDs", and "Targets".
            </p>
            <p class='blog-p-tag'>
                <b>A quick note here:</b> players in the top right of each of these graphs below are better, as all of the stats above are useful
                for fantasy purposes.

                        As usual, we start by taking a look at the position group with the lens of three tiers:

                            <li><b>Cluster 0 (Green):</b> The worst of the bunch above. That being said, these guys can still be WR3s or WR4s on a roster, so there's value to be had in this tier.</li>
                            <li><b>Cluster 1 (Blue):</b> The elite wide receivers. These players put up a lot of numbers, and are must haves on contending rosters.</li>
                            <li><b>Cluster 2 (Red):</b> The middle of the pack. The worst of the bunch still provides good WR3 value and the best provide some good WR1 options.</li>

                        For the most part, these tiers seem pretty reflective of expectations.
                        There are some players who are in far lower tiers, respective to their quality, but
                        this is largely due to injuries.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Players like Kupp, Chase, Deebo, Keenan Allen and Mike Williams drop a bit further that you would expect in these
                        rankings, but each of these guys had injury issues last year. Mike and Deebo played the most of these four,
                        with 13 games each.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Marquise Brown, Hopkins, DJ Moore are some other names in Cluster 0 that also deserve a mention for finishing in a tier lower
                        than you might expect. The first two were capped to 10 games or less due to injury issues and suspensions, respectively.
                        Moore simply had abysmal quarterback play in Carolina last season.

                        Outside of these fallers, the one, perhaps surprising, riser would be Zay Jones in my eyes. He had a career year last season, which led to
                        near WR2 production. I don't think there was a strong inclination to buy and capitablize on this performance, as Ridley was coming back for the Jags.

                        While the rest of the clusters are about what you'd expect, there still is intrigue in each of them.

                        In cluster 0 and 2, there is a lot of young talent.
                        London, Pickens, Watson, Olave, and Wilson headline the young group of talented receivers. I would buy any where I can, as I believe they will all get better.
                        London, Pickens and Watson are probably the best value buys for me at the moment, as they don't quite have the value or hype of Olave or Wilson, but I think they
                        have shown flashes of playing at an elite level.

                        Additionally, you have proven, young, studs like Amon-Ra, the Slim Reaper, and Waddle who could all break into Cluster 1, sooner or later (it seems the Sun God is definitely taking 
                        the sooner approach with his 2023 season thus far).

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Additionally, the worst of the group has remained the same, despite adding the extra tier.

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        So, the difference here is that we have split our middle of the pack wide receivers into two groups:
                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li>Those that get high targets and receptions but are not as strong at getting into the endzone or getting yardage (Cluster 0).</li>
                            <li>Those that are strong at getting into the endzone or getting yardage but don't get targeted or catch as much (Cluster 1).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        I would say that it is cool to see Garret Wilson and Amon-Ra in the target hog cluster, as I think both of those guys can add more yardage and touchdowns to
                        their game. Amon-Ra is already showcasing that this year, and I think Wilson could do the same once he gets a competent quarterback.

                        For the most part, things stay the same. There's some yo-yoing going on in this tier shift between the middle of the pack groups,
                        but all of the players in the middle groups have remained the same. Furthermore, the worst cluster is also the same as before.

                        The change with six tiers comes from the worst cluster in the previous graph being split into two: Cluster 0 and Cluster 4.
                        Essentially, the split occurs from the disparity in touchdown numbers between the two groups, as the rest of their stats are 
                        quite similar. Everyone in Cluster 0 had at least five touchdowns last season, whereas everyone in Cluster 4 had four or less
                        touchdowns. The rest of the picture stays more or less the same.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Now, from an individual perspective, there are a few points I'd like to mention. First, Olave and London being in Cluster 4 is not
                        that bad. That's still WR3 territory. Sure, you would want more production in the endzone, but the targets and yardage numbers are 
                        extremely encourging.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Olave had 72 receptions on 119 targets for 1042 yards last season. That's a really strong rookie season, especially
                        since Andy Dalton started 14 games. Now, is Derek Carr better for Olave? That's tough to say - it seemed so, until Kamara
                        came back from his suspension. That being said, Olave is young and is producing even more this year - breaking into WR2 territory - 
                        so I do like his future, and would pay up for him. That being said, we might not see him reach his ceiling until the Saints get a better
                        quarterback, or are more willing to throw it deep with Carr.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        The story is quite similar for London. He had a wonderful rookie season - 72 receptions on 117 targets for 866 yards - despite awful quarterback
                        play from Mariota and Ridder. London will probably end up with similar numbers to last season, which isn't ideal, but between Ridder and Heinicke, the 
                        quarterback play hasn't improved. In fact, it's probably worse this year, as Mariota had a QBR of 57.7 in 2022 and Ridder has a QBR of 39.4 through his nine
                        games this year. This makes London a great buy for me, because his value is severely deflated from horrible quarterback play, and there's not much room 
                        for the quarterbacks in Atlanta to get worse.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Outside of those two young bucks, CeeDee Lamb being in Cluster 1 with Adams, Diggs, and Brown is very encourging to me. I believe that, in addition to his performances
                        this year (top 5 wide receiver in PPR and half-PPR formats), CeeDee has solidified himself in that group of top receivers below Chase and Jefferson.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        In terms of vets that offer good value for their production, I would look to Lockett, Evans, and Cooper from Cluster 3 and Godwin and Diontae in Cluster 2.
                        All of them continue to provide, at least, WR3 production when healthy. Note, the highest valued player out of this group of vets 
                        on KTC (as of 10/20/22) is Evans, at WR32. That's really good value for any of them.

                        I think a lot more can be said, with how deep and exciting the wide receiver position is, but I'll leave it at that for the six tier analysis.

                        Some shifts do occur in this final tiering, but here are some final points:
                        <ul class='bullet-list'>
                            <li>Good to see both young players and vets in clusters 0, 1 and 4. Solid options for both rebuilders and contenders there, at reasonable prices.</li>
                            <li>
                                Intersting to see Davis and Watson together, but that seems largely due to Watson's injuries. Watson is a good investment for rebuilders in my eyes. He's flashed, but 
                                injuries and some quarterback concerns in 2023 have dampered his value. Davis is a solid boom-bust option, which I would argue differs from a healthy Watson.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Very promising for Garrett Wilson's stock to see him in a cluster with quality target hogs. A lot of talent in that group, and he may very well end up being the best player
                                in that cluster very soon.
                            </li>
                            <li>Hill and Jefferson have quite the gap on the players in Cluster 2. I would love to have either on my team, even if it means over paying.</li>
                            <li>
                                The same can be said for the four in Cluster 2, all of them are great wide receiver with strong production. This cluster is close to elite, 
                                but probably a bit cheaper (keeping in mind comparable options, i.e. vets to vets and young studs to young studs) in comparison to the players in Cluster 5.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        I think the clusters above are about what I would have expected from 2022.

                        A few highlights from splitting wide receivers into three tiers based on the per game numbers:

                                DJ Moore is a little lower than I would have thought. He really suffered last season from the quarterback play, and posted 
                                his worst year since his rookies season. Moore has turned things around in Chicago this season, and is on pace to have his best
                                fantasy season. I'm unsure about him going into next year, as I would suspect the Bears draft at least MHJ, if not a quarterback too.
                                Murky situation for 2024, as of now.

                                Hopkins was amazing in the nine games he played last year, finishing in the elite Cluster 1. You have to wonder how much of his struggles
                                this year are offense and quarterback related, given how he's played much better under Levis. Could be worth the risk for the remainder of 
                                this season and going into 2024, as he is worth about a 2025 late second on KTC (as of 10/21/23).

                                Zay Jones had the best season of his career last year, which was awesome if you had him, but Jones was a sell high for me. Ridley coming back
                                has hurt his production, but the injuries have really derailed Jones this year. That being said, he's still a critical piece for opening up the
                                Jags offense, just not really an important fantasy piece anymore.

                                It's good to see Chase in that top tier on a per game basis. Injuries derailed his totals last year.

                        There isn't too much movement with four tiers on a per game basis, but I will say it is good to see
                        DJ Moore in a higher quality cluster (see Cluster 3). 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        I also find it a bit more fitting for Hopkins to be in Cluster 0, as he does not have the per game touchdown numbers
                        to stick with Cluster 2. Hopkins scored a touchdown once every three games, or about 0.333 touchdowns per game.
                        Whereas the worst touchdown producer in Cluster 0, Hill, scored 0.412 touchdowns a game - which is about a one touchdown difference every ten games.

                                A little disheartening to see Dionate Johnson and Drake London in Cluster 0,
                                but I still see both as talented receivers that are in a poor quarterback situation.
                                Time to buy low?

                                Deebo was off the boil last year, and he likely will never be the 2021 version of himself again.
                                That being said, Purdy has taken a step this year, and for someone who still has a very high ceiling, I
                                don't mind paying for his current value (wr27 on KTC as of 10/21/23).

                                It's tough to see young bucks like Pickens and Watson in Cluster 3, but both have flashed, and I still think
                                they are good value for their price.

                                That elite tier, Cluster 1, has plenty of names to buy as a rebuilder or contender. The wide receiver position offers
                                a lot to like.

                        Biggest change here, and most interesting part of the six tiers,
                        is that both Hill and Lamb drop into the second best tier: Cluster 5.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        I am quite shocked to see Hill drop out of that elite tier in Cluster 1, a little bit less so for Lamb.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Based on the numbers, it seems like Hill falls out due to his lack of touchdowns per game. As, with the exception of
                        Jefferson, everyone in Cluster 1 has at least .064 touchdowns per game, or about two touchdowns every three game.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Lamb drops out of this tier because everything outside of his touchdown numbers would be an anomaly compared to the boys
                        in Cluster 1.

                        Some quick and final observations to end the piece:
                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li>
                                Hill rejoins Jefferson and Kupp in that elite tier. Kupp is a murky buy low in my opinion.
                                Kupp can clearly still produce if he and Stafford can stay healthy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                That second tier, represented by Cluster 5, is full of elite receivers, but I would be a bit disappointed
                                if I was a Chase owner.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cluster 0 also has some great producing players, at much more reasonable prices.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Can't go too wrong with a receiver from Cluster 2 or Cluster 4 either, a lot of solid production in both of those groups.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                That will do it for the analysis in this one!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                As always, my recap/takeaways:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>We are in a golden age of wide receiver talent!</li>
                <li>London is a great buy low. Has been a WR3 with some of the worst quarterback play in the NFL. It can only go up from here (I hope).</li>
                <li>Add Christian Watson to the list of buy lows. He flashed quite some ability in 2022, but injuries and quarterback concerns have depressed his value.</li>
                <li>There's a lot of good young (Wilson, Olave, Pickens, Watson, London, etc.) and old talent (Hopkins, Evans, Allen, etc.) for both rebuilders and contenders to buy.</li>
                <li>Plenty of studs at varying ages prices as well: Chase, Jefferson, Lamb, Brown, Adams, Diggs, Hill, etc.</li>
                <li>
                    Maybe Chase shouldn't be in the same tier as Jefferson? Yes, he has one of the most insane ceilings in fantasy, but his consistency is not quite at the same 
                    level as that of Jefferson. It seems Burrow is a big factor in keeping these two close in value, but does Dobbs change that?
                </li>
            </ul>
