      <h1>QBs in 2022</h1>

      <h2>TL;DR</h2>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Fields scares me: a dominant rusher, but his passing is a huge outlier</li>
          <li>Same for Jones, but to a lesser degree</li>
          <li>Jackson and Murray present interesting buy options to me, the latter more so in dynasty</li>

          <li>No obvious candidate to break up the big three or four</li>
          <li>Mahomes is nuts nuts</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Read on to see more in depth analysis on quarterback stats from last year, and what I think would yield a QB1
        season going forward.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2-blog">Overview</h2>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        The goal of this blog is going to be to try and recognize what makes a quarterback a QB1. The first set of blogs
        will likely be focusing on this recognition component.
        What makes a player likely to be in the top tier of their position group? To start, we'll be using data from
        2022.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        After this set of blogs I'll probably transition into more predictive blogs that focus on using ML models
        to determine whether or not a player can be in a certain tier of their position group.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Also a couple of points to consider for the data I will be analyzing:
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>I don't take into account anything related to two point conversions, partly due to
            the randomness and small sample size but mostly because it was difficult to incorporate into the data I
            fetched</li>
          <li>The top 30 QBs I analyze are by the top 30 fantasy point totals, this is done for
            simplicity and reusability of graphing code</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2-blog">Fantasy Points</h2>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        We want to find the tiers of quarterbacks and what value those tiers have.
        So, let us start by looking at how quarterbacks scored by fantasy points last year.
      </p>
      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img src="/Analysis/images/QB/Total Fantasy Points.png">
      </div>

      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        From this graph, we see a few things. First, there's a pretty big gap between Mahomes, Allen, Hurts, Burrow
        and the rest. Within this big four Burrow is a bit lower, and we see a tier one emerge with Mahomes, Allen,
        and Hurts.

        <br /><br />

        Additionally, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between Geno Smith and Tom Brady. From Brady onward
        it gets a little murky, but there are a few sub tiers. Let's go ahead and highlight some of these details on
        the graph to make it easier to see some insights.
      </p>
      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img src="/Analysis/images/QB/Total Fantasy Points-v2.png">
      </div>

      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        This clears things up a little more. We can see the gap between the top 4 and the rest of the QB1 tier is
        pretty big, bigger than the difference between Burrow and Hurts. Taking away these four QBs, we can also
        see that the difference between the rest of the best of the QBs isn't that big.

        <br /><br />

        One thing this graph shows pretty well is the variability in the QB2 pool, and how a high-end QB2 is still
        a pretty big downgrade to a low-end QB1, but let's touch on this even more with out next graph.
      </p>
      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img src="/Analysis/images/QB/Total Fantasy Points-v3.png">
      </div>


      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        <i>
          Note that in the graph, our proxies for these average values are Daniel Jones (who had 289 points)
          and Kyler Murray (who had 201 total points).
        </i>

        <br /><br />

        The average total fantasy points of the best of the rest is 288.875 and the average total fantasy points
        of the QB2 pool is 203.5. That's a difference of 85.375 points between a middling QB1 and an average QB2!
        In other words, you're sacrificing about 5 points per game starting an average QB2 or the average of the
        lower end of the QB1 spectrum.

        <br /><br />

        Now, while the difference from Burrow to the average middling QB1 is smaller at 62 points
        (~3.64 points per game), the difference from the average middling QB1 to someone in the elite
        tier of QBs (Mahomes, Allen, Hurst) is actually larger. Hurts had 378 total points last year,
        which gives us a difference of 89.125 points (or 5.24 points per game).

        <br /><br />

        The elite tier offers such a crazy positional advantage, and it is a pattern that repeats
        across other positions. So we can see that having quarterbacks in the elite tier is worth
        paying extra, and having a quaterback in the first tier is a must, especially in super-flex.

        <br /><br />

        Let us continue our exploration of the numbers and see what happens when we take into account
        injuries, i.e. let us see if anything changes when looking at points per game.
      </p>
      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img src="/Analysis/images/QB/Fantasy Points Per Game.png">
      </div>

      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Suddenly the picture starts to get a bit more murky as to who provides value. The elite tier
        still is extremely valuable, but this tier itself gets much more interesting. Hurts jumps
        to the top of the tier with an incredible 25.2 points per game, whereas Mahomes and Allen
        have 24.47 and 24.75 points per game, respectively.

        <br /><br />

        Additionally, guys like Lamar Jackson and Kyler Murray appear to have much more value
        than on first glance. The two sit at QB5 and QB6 with 19.66 and 18.27 points per game,
        respectively.

        <br /><br />

        Moreover, the picture gets even more muddled with more quarterbacks in tier two of total points
        - Tua and Dak - leapfrogging quarterbacks in tier one - Brady and Herbert.

        <br /><br />

        Looking back at the elites, our bridge between this elite tier and the best of the rest,
        Burrow, sits at 21.93 points per game, whereas Fields - who is top of the best of the
        rest - sits at 19.73 points per game.

        <br /><br />

        I would take away a couple of things from this. The first is that positional advantage
        really does make a difference. Having a guy in the elite tier is a huge advantage in
        fantasy, especially if they can be acquired for at or below "market value", which feeds
        into my strategy of trying to get value by going best player available.

        <br /><br />

        As a slight tangent, what do I mean by "market value". Well, let's say that Hurts is being
        drafted as the QB3 in 2023 (which was frequently the case). Based on his points per game
        numbers and his situation remaining largely unchanged (a good thing in this case), I would
        expect him to perform similarly to his 2022 numbers. This means you could obtain the QB1
        in fantasy for the price of QB3, and situations like this that present arbitrage are where
        championships are won (and lost).

        <br /><br />

        The second takeaway is that injuries offer a great opportunity to grab players at
        discounts. Dak, Tua, and Kyler all fit this bill (Kyler more so in dynasty). These
        are all quarterbacks who can perform at or close to the QB 1 tier and can probably be
        acquired for less than an average QB 1.

        <br /><br />

        Returning to the analysis, here's another representation of what we've seen so far:
      </p>
      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img src="/Analysis/images/QB/Total Fantasy Points-by-Fantasy Points Per Game.png">
      </div>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        This kind of confirms to us those quarterbacks that might be sneaking under their radar for their value,
        specifically players like
        Hurts, Jackson, Murray, Tagovailoa, and Prescott - all them potentially undervalued as their total points from
        2022 misrepresents
        their capabilities.

        <br /><br />

        Before diving more into the stats of the top 30 quarterbacks from 2022, I do want to acknowledge that both
        Herbert and Lawrence have
        fallen under the radar in this analysis. These are two names that haven't really been mentioned so far, as they
        don't stand out in
        the graphs we've seen so far. However, I do feel both are great quarterbacks moving forward in fantasy, as they
        should both
        continue to improve.

        <br /><br />

        Lawrence should get even better with Ridley joining his wide receiver core this upcoming season and another
        year of Doug Pederson's tutelage are things to consider.

        <br /><br />

        Herbert will be heading into this season fully healthy and with a fully healthy wide receiver core that added QJ
        from the draft.
        As a result, his situation should improve as well.

        <br /><br />

        Numbers are important, but context does matter!
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2-blog">Passing Yards</h2>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Finally let's dive into our first stat that isn't just fantasy points. Let us start by examining passing yards
        for these quarterbacks.
      </p>
      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img class="multi-img" src="/Analysis/images/QB/Total Passing Yards.png">

      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        <i>
          Note, the yellow for that tier two of quarterbacks has been replaced by orange, as the yellow is really hard
          to see on the graph
          type of the right.
        </i>

        <br /><br />

        A few interesting things pop out from these graphs.

        <br /><br />

        First, Fields' passing production is really bad. Sitting at 2242 yards, he is far
        away from the rest of the QB1 pack, which bottoms out at 3701 yards, assuming we remove the two outliers from
        the pack (Daniel Jones
        being the other).

        <br /><br />

        This scared me in my dynasty league personally, and so I moved off of him and upgraded (I hope) to Trevor
        Lawrence. I'm not sure that his numbers are sustainable - he reminds me of a lesser and more inbalanced version
        of Lamar Jackson's
        MVP season. We haven't seen Lamar recreate those numbers, granted he and the Ravens have had plenty of injuries
        to deal with since then,
        but Lamar has shown that he is a far better passer than Fields. Additionally, Fields has never had the talent
        Lamar has had around
        him, which makes it tough to be a believer, even as a Bears fan.

        <br /><br />

        I do have some hindsight now, given two weeks into the season, but it is starting to feel like this take on fearing Fields has been justified:
      </p>

      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Big shoutout to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheQBSchool/featured">QB School</a>, which is a great
        YouTube channel by
        JT O'Sullivan breaking down QB film.

        <br /><br />

        Now in addition to Fields, four other quarterbacks pop out to me as being a little too rushing dependent: Allen,
        Hurts, Jones and
        Jackson. Of these four, I'm not really worried about Hurts or Allen as they are still passing for great numbers,
        with Hurts at 3701 yards and Allen at 4283 yards.

        <br /><br />

        However, I am worried about Daniel Jones. He did have 3205 yards, but I'm not sure the Giants offense can
        support his growth.
        Daboll is a great play caller, but it doesn't seem like they did enough to help him out in the passing game.
        Waller is a big
        question mark, and Saquon's health is one I would question -
        <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/giants-rb-saquon-barkley-considered-week-to-week-with-ankle-sprain">especially
          now</a>
        (again hindsight). Outside of that, there is some young talent, but it is largely unproven, which I believe
        makes it tough to
        be a Jones believer. I would avoid Jones, or sell high on him (if you can with his start) as I don't see him
        improving much
        as a passer, and I don't know if his rushing numbers are sustainable. All that being said, I am not nearly as
        afraid of him
        as I am of Fields, and I think you could justify him progressing under Daboll or being lucky with some injuries
        around him.

        <br /><br />

        If we dive deeper into the data our concerns for Fields grow tremendously. Additionally, there are more concerns
        for Jones and Jackson:
      </p>

      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img class="multi-img" src="/Analysis/images/QB/Passing Yards Per Game.png">
        <img class="multi-img" src="/Analysis/images/QB/Fantasy Points Per Game-by-Passing Yards Per Game.png">
      </div>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        While Jackson did break into the top ten quarterbacks by points per game, his passing yards per game last season
        leave something
        to be desired, with only 186.83 yards per game. Now, the encouraging thing is that this season he has the best
        wide receiver core
        he has ever had (I really love Zay Flowers!), and the offense is supposedly changing to suit his strengths.
        We'll see how things
        go, but I am more optimistic about him than Jones and Fields.

        <br /><br />

        I think these two graphs really do showcase the concerns about Fields' passing. Even with DJ Moore, a full
        season of Claypool,
        and line upgrades, can he really improve to 200 yards a game passing? I'm skeptical... This makes it really
        tough to believe in
        him long term. I think it is far more believable that both Jones and Jackson improve their passing numbers and
        thus become more
        sustainable quarterbacks, long term, compared to Fields.

        <br /><br />

        On the flip side, I think these charts show how insane Mahomes is. His passing numbers are off the charts, and
        that is
        what you love to see for sustainable, long term, quarterback play.

        <br /><br />

        Additionally, I think this showcases that
        Herbert
        is a strong candidate to return the the top five quarterbacks in fantasy. Even with the injuries to him and the
        rest of
        his offense he was still putting up close to 280 yards a game (278.76 yards per game to be precise).
        This is only bested by Burrow (279.68) and Mahomes (308.82).
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2-blog">Rushing Yards</h2>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Yes, we just complained about some quarterbacks being waaaayy too dependent on their rushing abilities, but that
        doesn't mean that
        rushing isn't an important part of the modern quarterback's arsenal. Rushing still is an important part of a
        quarterback's game and it
        is worth analyzing, it just shouldn't be the main way a quarterback gets their points as it isn't sustainable
        (see shelf life of
        running backs, injuries to rushing dominant quarterbacks, and the numbers behind the previous elite
        quarterbacks).

        I'm throwing a lot at you here, but my main takeaway from this is how impressive of a rusher Fields is.
        He is absolutely <b>ELITE</b>, with Jackson being the only real one 'close' to him last year. For those
        who are high on Fields, this is what excites you! His rushing capabilites give him a very high ceiling,
        but the big question remains: can he improve as a passer to jump into the top caliber of fantasy quarterbacks
        and develop a more sustainable game? Again, I'm very skeptical about that happening.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        This probably offers a lot more optimism for Jackson, as from these charts Lamar's rushing numbers are also very
        impressive
        - just not quite Fields insanity levels - and he has shown he can be a very good passer.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Outside of those two, this kinda confirms what we saw when comparing fantasy points versus passing yards, where
        we have these five
        quarterbacks who are all really good at rushing, but only two had a great passing base: Hurts and Allen. That
        being said,
        Jackson has shown to have a higher passing base than both Jones and Fields, so I would be most optimistic about
        him out of the these
        three, to the point where I think he could be had for really good value; however, it should be noted his value
        is hard to gauge as he was going as high as QB4 in drafts
        and as low as around QB8.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Outside of these five rushing heavy quarterbacks, Murray stands out to me as a brigde between the more
        traditional pocket passers and these rushing monsters. He has had big rushing seasons in the past, but Murray
        has been pretty balanced as a quarterback (he's always had above 3700 passing yards bar his 2022 season). The
        obvious
        concern about him is how he will recover from his injury and if the Cards will move on from him or address the
        talent
        deficit around him. Either way, I'd be buying in dynasty as he's valued around QB18 on KTC as of 9/22/23 and I
        think he has at least
        a few more QB1 seasons in him.

        One last thing to note, if you can get yourself a quarterback who can rush for 600 plus yards a season, they don't
        have
        to be an elite passer to be a QB1. If they are an elite passer, then you have a gem. The NFL is moving
        towards
        mobile quarterbacks, finding those guys who can rush for big numbers but still have great arms and processing
        power will
        win you championships.

      <h2 class="h2-blog">Total Yards</h2>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        For the sake of being comprehensive, let us take a look at the total yards picture:
      </p>
      <div class="blog-img-container">

      </div>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        From this we see four quarterbacks really standout: Mahomes, Allen, Hurts, and Burrow. Hurts and Burrow are
        barely
        under the 300 yards per game marker (297.4 and 295.75, respectively), while Mahomes and Allen obliterate the
        marker
        (329.88 and 315.31, respectively). This, to me, once again shows how dominant Mahomes is, but it also highlights
        the gap
        between these four - with Burrow really being a bridge between the big three and the other quarterbacks - and
        the rest
        of the quarterbacks.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Outside of the incredible numbers from those guys, both Herbert and Tua impress me here, as they seem to
        separate from
        the rest of the pack (of active quarterbacks). Herbert had 287.41 total yards per game. Tua had 278.30 total
        yards per game.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        From the negatives to point out, Murray falls a bit back down to earth for me on these graphs, as he sits pretty
        firmly in the
        middle of that large pack of potential QB1 caliber players, on a per game basis. He doesn't solidify his
        candidacy of being
        the quarterback from the best of the rest to jump into the elite tier, or at least bridge the gap.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        I think Fields still sticks out like a sore thumb with his 225.66
        total yards per game. I get that rushing yards are more valuable than passing yards, but the concerns I've
        iterated throughout
        this analysis remain for me.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        In contrast, Jackson and Jones are much closer than Fields is to that pack of potential QB1 talent, which is why
        I'm
        less concerned about them: they can put up the total yardage you want to see, even if they rely more on their
        legs compared to
        other quarterbacks.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2-blog">Other Passing Stats</h2>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Let us move on to examining some other relevant passing statistics, such as completion percentage, completions and
        passing attempts.
      </p>
      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img class="multi-img" src="/Analysis/images/QB/Completion Percentage.png">
        <img class="multi-img" src="/Analysis/images/QB/Total Passing Completions-by-Total Passing Attempts.png">
      </div>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        The top three quarterbacks for completion percentage separate themselves from the rest of the pack, and form the
        only really obvious tier for me.
        For those who believe in Herbert, this is pretty good to see, as the kid has 68.2 completion percentage. Burrow
        is at 68.31% and, surprisingly Geno
        is number one at 69.75%.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Outside of those three, it seems having a completion percentage of around 65% or higher is a good indicator of
        being a QB1. Additionally, if you pass more
        than 500 times in a season you will also likely be a QB1. This seems to be a common lesson amongst position
        groups: volume good, efficiency good, both excellent!
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Before moving on, I do want to mention that I was surprised that Josh Allen had such a low completion
        percentage: 63.3%. I guess his high volume and legs make up
        for his lack of accuracy.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Lastly, and I feel like a broken record here, Fields sticks out like a sore thumb again, and not for the best
        reasons. His completion percentage is almost dead last
        at 60.37%. <b>Yikes!</b>
      </p>

      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img src="/Analysis/images/QB/Passing Attempts Per Game.png">
      </div>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Looking more into attempts per game seems to hammer home the point that volume helps. 29.5 attempts per game
        pretty much guarantees you to be a QB1 or QB2. Fields worries me again,
        with only 21.2 attempts per game.
      </p>

      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img src="/Analysis/images/QB/Passing Completions Per Game.png">
      </div>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        19.81 completions per game is the threshold for being in those QB1 and QB2 tier. This somewhat adds up with out
        attempts per game and completion percentage findings as 19.81 completions
        on 29.5 attempts yields a completion percentage of 67.15%, which would put you in decent company, but not
        necessarily guarantee QB1 or QB2 status.

      <h2 class="h2-blog">Touchdowns</h2>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Before concluding our analysis, let us go ahead and take a look at touchdowns.
      </p>
      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img class="multi-img" src="/Analysis/images/QB/Total Touchdowns (Qb)-by-Total Passing Touchdowns.png">
        <img class="multi-img" src="/Analysis/images/QB/Total Touchdowns (Qb)-by-Total Rushing Touchdowns.png">
      </div>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        It seems that a QB1 does need to have about 25 total touchdowns, of which most tend to be of the passing variety
        (unless you
        are a one Mr. Fields).
      </p>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Outside of that, it seems that the truly elite get 35+ total touchdowns a year, really 40+ (if we ignore Hurts).
      </p>

      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        Hurts'
        rushing touchdowns are impressive at 13. I'm not sure whether he could increase that number or not this year,
        given how
        deadly that Eagles offense is, and the fact that he is probably their most dangerous goaline threat (via the
        pass or run).
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2-blog">Summary</h2>
      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        If you somehow made it this far, here are my final thoughts:
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Fields scares me a lot this year and in the future - he is an elite rusher, but his passing game really
          scares me</li>
        <li>This applies somewhat to Danny Dimes as well, but to a lesser degree as his passing floor seems to be much
          higher</li>
        <li>Jackson and Murray are both intriguing candidates to jump into that elite tier of quarterbacks, with the
          caveat of dynasty format for Murray</li>
        <li>Hurts is my QB1 overall for this year, as I expect him to play more (more competitive games) and take
          another step</li>
        <li>Herbert and TLaw are also strong candidates in my eyes to take a jump and either enter the elite tier or be
          a bridge (like Burrow)</li>
        <li>All that being said I am not sure there is a sure fire quarterback who breaks up the trio of
          Mahomes/Allen/Hurts or even surpasses Burrow, especially from a dynasty view</li>
        <li>Mahomes is nuts nuts</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="blog-p-tag">
        And the standards to be a QB1 are something like:
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>4000 total yards (of that about 3500 passing)</li>
        <li>About 25 passing touchdowns, but 25 total touchdowns also works</li>
        <li>Completion percentage doesn't seem to matter as much as a success indicator, but higher than 66% is good
        </li>
        <li>Want your guy to complete at least 22 passes a game</li>
        <li>Want your guy to attempt at least 30 passes a game, but 35 passes a game is *chef's kiss*</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

        That brings this first analysis to a wrap! I hope y'all enjoyed it and I look forward to joining you on the next
        one!
