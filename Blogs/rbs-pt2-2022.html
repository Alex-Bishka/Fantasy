            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Quality backs can be effective in different ways. Backs that put up god awful rushing numbers can still be in the RB1 and RB2 tier.</li>
                <li>ETN flashed signs last year - for those that paid attention and pounced during the offseason, congrats on getting him! For those that didn't, he's still worth paying up for.</li>
                <li>Swift is worth buying, even if his price has gone up. He has a soft playoff schedule and I think he will only get better given his efficiency and how good the situation is in Philly.</li>
                <li>Monty is similar to Swift from a value perspective, but I would pay less for him. He isn't as talented as Swift and Monty is a little older. He's the Jamaal Williams Deluxe of this season.</li>
                <li>Conner still has some juice in him - very much worth the risk, especially with an IR discount.</li>
                <li>Pierce feels like a decent buy low with the expectation of getting some decent numbers for this year, if only on volume. I don't think he is a future proof back by any means.</li>
                <li>Raschaad White is putrid. Sell where you can, if you can. The outlook on White for me is a worse Pierce... but wait until he strings together a few PPR performances.</li>
                <li>Taylor is a good future investment, his down year still led to great numbers. Now that his contract is sorted and AR looks the part, he has a high ceiling for upcoming seasons.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                This week I go ahead and continue my analysis on running back performance in 2022,
                by using my clustering tooling to examine tiers of running backs.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I would like to point out that I've updated my clustering to be interactive as well, so you
                can hover over players in the graph to see their numbers and figure out what cluster they are in.
            </p>

                My data disclaimer, as always:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>I don't take into account anything related to two point conversions, partly due to
                    the randomness and small sample size but mostly because it was difficult to incorporate into the
                    data I
                    fetched</li>
                <li>The top 40 RBs I analyze are by the top 40 fantasy point totals, this is done for
                    simplicity and reusability of graphing code</li>
            </ul>
            </p>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">Tiers (Rushing Totals)</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                We'll start by examining pair plots with rushing statistics, specifically the following:
                "Rushing Yards", "Carries", "Yards Per Carry", "Rushing Touchdowns", and "Fumbles".
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Our clustering tooling will split up the backs into tiers based on the similarity of their
                stats and number of clusters specified.

                After taking a gander at the graph, I would classify the clusters as the following: Cluster 0 as "The Anemic Rushers",
                Cluster 1 is more of the "Eh, it's a day job" type, and Cluster 2 gives off "Hulk SMASH!" vibes.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                These observations pretty much throwout fumbles and yards per carry, as each of the clusters are all over the
                place for those stats. With that being taken into account, Cluster 0 is towards the bottom in rushing yards, carries,
                and rushing touchdowns, while Cluster 2 is killing it in that regard, and Cluster 1 fits snuggly inbetween.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I'm surprised that both Leonard Fournette and Jerick McKinnon were able to put up the seasons (RB12 and RB20, respectively in PPR)
                they did while being so bad at putting such bad rushing related stats.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I guess you can find yourself a viable fantasy back that doesn't have a large impact in the running game.
                Something to keep an eye out for during any season, as a solid contributor could be had on the cheap.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                On that note, Raschaad White concerns me here, especially since the per game numbers (we will get there) don't reflect well for him either.
                I'm a little surprised he's kept his job this year, I am very high on Sean Tucker, but I might have been wrong on my Tucker take.
                I'd probably try and move of White is possible, he is a back to me that is very replaceable, from an NFL roster perspective.
                since the 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Moving onto Cluster 1, I am surprised a few backs are in this group instead of the rushers that grab the most stats.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                CMC and ETN are the two that were the most shocking for me, as they had excellent rushing yard and carry stats.
                CMC had 1139 rushing yards on 244 carries and ETN had 1125 rushing yards on 220 carries.
                Their rushing touchdown numbers, 8 for CMC and 5 for ETN, keep them out of the elite rushing stat padders.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                If you were also surprised by Mixon, Jones, Pollard, and Rhamondre, I was too at first, but their rushing and carry stats
                were definitely lower than both CMC and ETN. Touchdowns were spread out amongst this group. I will say this makes sense with
                what we are seeing from ETN this year, and even with that being said he might still be a good buy with his youth and the talent on that
                Jags offense.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Finally, our last tier to analyze: the monsters! These backs put up great rushing numbers last year, but some players in this list
                surprised me.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Ekeler was shocking to me, as I didn't think of him as a dominant rusher, and when checking the stats that seems to be true:
                915 rushing yards and 204 carries... but 13 rushing touchdowns catapults him into this tier.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Outside of that, the name that stunned me here was Elliot.
            </p>
                
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Yes, Najee and Jamaal aren't sexy backs, but they get enough volume and touchdowns
                to sneak into that tier. Elliot gets himself into this category, despite putting up less than 900 rushing yards. His 12 rushing touchdowns and
                231 carries seem to just barely get him into this tier.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h3-blog">RBs as Four Tiers</h3>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                With all that being said, let's see if we can get more nuance with four tiers:

                Now that we have added another layer of distinction between backs, we see our top tier is relatively unchanged, 
                the middle tier gets splits into two parts, and the bottom tier is the same.

                The middle tier is now split into Cluster 1 (Red) and Cluster 2 (Green), and this seems to be caused by fumbles.
                The backs in the former group all have three or less fumbles, whereas those in the latter tier all have three or
                more fumbles.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I don't see this insight as super valuable, unless you fear one of the backs in green may lose his job over fumble
                problems, but that seems like a non-cocern for the backs in green that still have starting jobs after offseason moves.

                One last thing to point out, Elliot drops out of the elite tier and into Cluster 1, the good, non-fumbling rushing backs.

                Interesting, the previous top tier gets split into two tiers: Cluster 0 (Green) and Cluster 3 (Blue). No other changes occur.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                My observation here is that Cluster 0 fumbles less, has better rushing yard totals, and yards per carry. These backs have
                at most 3 fumbles, at least 1269 rushing yards, and average at least 4.45 yards per carry.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Meanwhile, the backs in Cluster 3 have at least 3 fumbles, only one player above 1200 rushing yards and no back above 4.5 yards a carry.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The carry and rushing touchdown stats are a little blurry between these two groups of backs.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                It is also worth noting Henry is not in Cluster 0, which I would call the better rushers, but it seems his fumbles, touchdowns and yards per carry
                make him a closer fit with Cluster 3.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                We have our touchdown hogs - with a bit of a fumbling problem - in Cluster 1.
                All of these guys have at least 13 touchdowns on the ground and at least 3 fumbles.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The best tier of backs here, for these rushing stats, is Cluster 3.
                They all have at least 1139 rushing yards and 244 carries.
                Additionally, they are all decently efficient, with the yards per carry varying from 4.45 to 5.05.
                Their nose for the endzone isn't bad as the group varies from 8-12 touchdowns, and all of them have less than 3 fumbles.
                Word of caution - I would avoid Sanders in Carolina, as I think these numbers were largely a product of that Eagles oline
                and offense.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 0 and Cluster 2 both contain more middling backs. Not great at anything, but also not bad at anything.
                Cluster 2 is slightly better from an efficiency perspective and slightly worse with fumbles.
                Cluster 0 is better at getting into the endzone.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 4 contians our hyper-efficient backs, who don't really fumble. These backs don't get a ton of carries and have
                pretty meh rushing yardage totals. Their touchdowns are also on the middle to lower side of things, but holy hell are 
                they extremely efficient. The least efficient back in this group, is Patterson with 4.83 yards per carry... the most 
                efficient is Swift with <b>5.47 yards per carry!</b>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I said it in part one, Swift is worth grabbing, especially as a contender. He's in a better situation than last year. The Eagles are handling
                him better and he's getting more opportunities. I think he could explode later in the season, especially in the playoffs against
                the Giants (week 16 at home) and the Cardinals (week 17 at home). I'd happily pay a first for him as a contender, and I would be
                ecstatic if he is my RB2 or RB3.

                Our backs with an aversion to rushing stats continue to stick together, that tier keeps on chugging in the form
                of Cluster 2 in the graph above.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Our hyper-efficient group of backs has become a bit more muddled, see Cluster 5, with Murray and Foreman joining in. This was unexpected,
                but the rest of their stats are pretty in line with other backs in that group.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Murray does intrigue me a bit. He still seems to have a bit of juice compared to other vet backs, and if
                James Cook goes down he could be very valuable down the stretch. A handcuff I would roster if the space is available
                and if you can get him for nothing.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The touchdown hog tier in Cluster 6 has shrunk, losing Henry. This makes a little more sense to me as Ekeler and Williams 
                were not great at piling up rushing numbers outside of touchdowns, whereas Henry offers more.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The elite tier of rushers has shifted a bit, and we now end up with Jacobs, Henry and Chubb in Cluster 4. These are the guys
                that put up big numbers overall, but aren't necesarilly efficient.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 3 and Cluster 1 both contian the middling backs.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 3 is more prone to fumbling, but has slightly more rushing yards, and is efficient.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 1 has slightly more carries and more rushing touchdowns.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I suppose I would rather have the backs in Clusters 3, with ETN and Taylor being my favorites in that tier.
                Although, Monty is still a favorite of mine as I see him replacing Williams in Cluster 6 by the end of this year.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Lastly, we have Cluster 0, which appears to contain the backs who are slighlty behind those that can
                post elite rushing numbers in Cluster 4.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                That being said, I would still love to have or pay for CMC as a contender, especially with how he has played this year.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Saquon concerns me a bit more as I wasn't high on the Giants offense coming into the season, and they are playing worse
                than I expected. So maybe there is a buy low opportunity there for contenders that believe in him?
                Keep in mind he doesn't have the easiet matchups come playoff time.

                The dumpster fire tier remains! Cluster 1 contains the same backs that were really poor at rushing totals. Yikes for
                Rachaad White.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 2 is the tier of backs that puts up the most rushing numbers. It changes a little on a per game basis, as now
                we see K9, James Conner, Pierce and Taylor enter it.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I'm a little surprised to see Pierce and Conner there.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                As I said in part one, Conner is worth grabbing as a contender. He shouldn't be too expensive, and with Murray coming back
                he should be even better once he comes back from IR. The IR might also provide even more of a discount for contenders.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Pierce has struggled this year, and I was worried about him, as I expected the Texans to be worse than the bottom of the barrel.
                Stroud has changed that outlook on the overall offense, but Pierce has struggled. I think he might be a sneaky buy low to help contenders
                this year, but buyer's beware: Pierce is not that talented and I could see the Texans trying to get a better back to
                surround Stroud with more talent.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Our final tier, Cluster 2, has backs that piled decent but not great or bad rushing numbers.
                There are some pretty talented backs in this category, so it goes to show that elite backs don't
                always provide their fantasy numbers via rushing.

                On a per game basis our group of backs with the best rushing stats has shrunk much quicker. Cluster 3 has superstar backs, 
                plus touchdown darling Williams, and Eagles oline merchant Miles Sanders. It really is crazy how much an oline and a 
                situation can boost your stock as a back, as these two have no business being mentioned with the others in that tier.

                Then Cluster 0 and Cluster 2 separates the middle of the pack based on fumbles again, with Cluster 2 have way less fumbles
                on a per game basis. Otherwise, these tiers are pretty even when looking at the graph.

                The worst tier, Cluster 2, stays the same. As well as the elite tier, in Cluster 1.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The group of running backs in the middle tier that had less fumbling problems remains largely the same. The only difference
                is that Swift moves out of Cluster 0.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                So, now we have two tiers to essentially split the backs who were in the middling tier, with more fumbling problems.
                Cluster 3 seems to hold the backs that get more rushing yards per game and more carries per game.
                Cluster 4 has the backs with better efficiency.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I want to spend a second on Taylor and Kamara from Cluster 3.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Taylor did well last year depsite health concerns and the Colts taking a step back. Plus, with how Moss has
                played this year, you could see Taylor improving his numbers as he gets healthier and the season goes on. Taylor could
                be really exciting once AR is fully healthy.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Taylor had the most rushing yards and carries per game in Cluster 3 with 78.27 yards on 17.45 carries per game.
                It's not bad efficiency at 4.48 yards a carry. Also, Taylor had a touchdown roughly once every three games. That
                excites me, as a down year for him is still very good and the situation seems to be getting better in Indy.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I am also interested in Kamara because his rushing numbers seem pretty solid, which bolster his speciality as a receiver.
                He had 59.8 rushing yards per game on 14.86 carries per game. There are some concerns with his efficiency, as he only
                had 4.02 yards per carry last year. Additionally, he doesn't get into the endzone much as a rusher with less than one 
                touchdown every five games. That being said, it's a decent rushing base for someone who is very dangerous in the receiving game.
                Also, Carr should elevate his game compared to Dalton.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Kamara has started off hot since coming back from suspension and I don't think it's crazy to think he finishes as
                a top ten running back in PPR formats with how many targets he's currently getting. Might be good value for contenders,
                but the buy for cheap window is almost certainly gone.

                The worst tier is consistent as ever, not a name changes in that tier represented by Cluster 2 above.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Our elite tier of ruhsers, Cluster 0, has lost Miles Sanders, and it has the names you would expect from last season in
                Jacobs, Henry, Barkley, and Chubb.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Sanders is just too far behind those guys, in regards to his ruhsing yards per game and his carries per games. He was at 74.64 
                ruhsing yards on 15.23 carries a game. Meanwhile, the other monsters had at least 82 rushing yards on 17.76 yards a game.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 3 picks up Sanders, and loses Foreman and Murray. This is the group of good, but not great rushers that doens't fumble
                much.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                It's good to see K9 in it, as a Walker stan. Additionally, Swift in this group shows that he isn't just a hyper-efficient guy, but
                can produce good numbers when given opportunities. Again, very excited for Swift as long as he stays with the Eagles.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 4 remains unchanged, this is another group of good but not great backs, who fumble a bit more than Cluster 3.
                Otherwise, these two groups are very similar, with Cluster 4 scoring less.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 6 is the next worst group of backs, when it comes to accumulating rushing stats. That being said, they are closer
                to the middling back groups than they are to Cluster 2.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                It is kinda sad to see Mixon in Cluster 6, especially since he is (or at least was) viewed as a top fantasy back.
                Given his situation hasn't really changed, I'm not optmistic for him going forward and would sell if I could get something
                like a first or two seconds. That being said, he probably has at least one more year in him for contenders.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Foreman and Murray have been moved to this tier in Cluster 6, which doesn't excite me for any of the other players in that
                group (sorry Dillon owners), bar Monty due to his tremendous situation in Detroit.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 5 and Cluster 1 separate the tier from the previous graph that was represented as Cluster 0.
                This was the group of middling backs that was slightly better at rushing yards per game and carries per game.
                They also score touchdowns at a much higher rate, but were meh-to-bad at efficiency.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                This separation makes a distinction on touchdowns per game. The two clusters are pretty similar otherwise, but Cluster 5
                does score quite a bit more.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Big ups to Conner for being in the same tier as Ekeler and Williams, as those two were 
                ruhsing touchdown monsters last year. Once again, a great buy for contenders, especially with the IR discount.

                Addtionally, K9 being in Cluster 0 is interesting, as this might allow Charbonent to take up the passing down role for
                the Seahawks. Something to keep an eye on, as the rookie gets integrated into the offense.

                Outside of that, I am a little surprised that both Pollard and ETN are not in Cluster 1, I thought they were a bit better
                in the receiving game.

                A quick breakdown of the clusters:

                    <li><b>Cluster 0:</b> Middle of the pack receiving backs, they don't particularly excel at anything, but they aren't putrid at anything either.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 1:</b> The worst of the worst. These backs only know how to run, hopefully.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 2:</b> Gods amongst backs.</li>

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                McKinnon in his own tier makes a lot of sense to me. He's a Cluster 3 guy with elite touchdown numbers.
                For that reason I thought he would be pretty decent as a zero running back option in PPR leauges, yet that
                hasn't happened so far. I would still keep an eye on McKinnon, as he did come on late last year, but this is a take
                that hasn't panned out for me so far.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Swift in Cluster 3 highlights his value in my eyes. In terms of rushing, he was in the CMC tier.
                In receiving, he's put himself in a good position.
                Swift is someone I want anywhere I am contending and have pieces to buy him.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The rest seems pretty expected to me.
                I don't see a huge difference between those in the high end of Cluster 1 (Chubb, K9, Taylor) and Cluster 0, so, for me, these
                backs are not ones I invest in because they have a high receiving ceiling.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The interesting tiers for me are Clusters 2, 3, and 4, as these are areas where we could potentially identify a back who puts
                up good receiving numbers (enough to be fantasy relevant), but is undervalued.

                If I'm not trying to purchase the elite players (CMC and Ekeler), I would take a look at those in Clusters 1 and 4,
                and maybe the McKinnon experiment (but that dream might already be dead).
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                These players have a decent receiving base, from 200-520 receiving yards a season on 35-75 catches a season, with up
                to 5 touchdowns. That's not bad production, especially if there is some rushing production to go along with it.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                There are some studs in this cluster, but for my money I would put it on Swift and Conner. They see to be the most undervalued
                in my eyes, as both can produce borderline RB1 numbers on a per game basis.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I think Kamara also desrves a shout, but his price may have exploded after his return from suspension. That would be my only 
                hesitation on purchasing Kamara over Swift or Conner. I think for a similar price you could get Swift and Conner is a great
                budget option.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I want to also highlight that Rachaad White is in Cluster 1, so he may have some redeeming qualities in PPR settings. I 
                still don't see a special player when I watch him, but 50 receptions on 58 targets for 290 yards is not bad from a
                production perspective, especially since he was behind Big Lenny.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I would sell after a couple of big PPR performances, like the one he just had on TNF against the Bills. Perhaps package him
                in a deal for Kamara, Ekeler, or Swift. Ekeler may be especially worth it due to his rough start to this season.

                Kamara is the back that stands out to me from this clustering.
                He's in that tier of backs that is just behind the Gods and has looked good so far this year.
                I think he could improve on his catches to target ratio with Carr, so a big buy for me.

                Conner is also in Cluster 5, so I'll keep pushing him as a great budget option for contenders.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Note, ETN has popped into Cluster 5. He is a back I really like, and think is one of the more future proof guys in the
                NFL due to his age and situation. I expect him to be pricey, but if you can splurge, I see it as a good investment.

                A quick breakdown of each tier:
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li><b>Cluster 0:</b> These backs provide a little production in the passing game, but not enough to be viable off of just receiving numbers.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 1:</b> The Gods.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 2:</b> The dumpster.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 3:</b> Decent receiving production on a per game basis. Slightly worse than Cluster 4, but the touchdown numbers salvage them.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 4:</b> Really good receiving backs that are only held back by their receiving touchdowns.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                That green group (Cluster 4) has some players in it that I really like to grab as a contender.
                Again, we see Kamara, Swift and Conner being very valuable in the passing game.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I cannot iterate enough how much I like each of these players for contenders. They are great purchases in PPR formats for those
                who don't want to break the bank for Ekeler and CMC.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The purple tier also offers some value in Pollard and Jones, and I do like both of these players.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Although, Pollard is someone who I see priced closer to his ceiling that other backs, so I love the player, but not at his current price.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Jones is someone I prefer more as he can be had for less and gives contenders a great RB2.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Some of you may have noticed Perine and Gibson in these good, but not great tiers. I'm not a fan of either player.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Gibson fumbles too much and seems put himself in the dog house frequently. Also, judging by his performances so far, volume
                is a big concern.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                As for Perine, I don't like Denver very much this year. Also, most of his production came in 3-4 games last year, and I find
                it hard for him to build on that for the remainder of the season.

                The breakdown for six tiers:
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li><b>Cluster 0:</b> Provide some receiving production, but not much.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 1:</b> Good receiving backs that are held back by their receiving touchdowns.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 2:</b> CMC and Ekeler.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 3:</b> The dumpster.</li>

                    <li><b>Cluster 5:</b> A worse version of Cluster 1, but with more touchdown production.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                It's good to see Swift, Kamara and Conner in that tier that is below the Gods, CMC and Ekeler.
                This continues to reinforce my belief in them.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Mixon being in that tier should be a relief to owners, as at least his receiving numbers prop up his value as a fantasy asset a bit.
                That being said, Mixon is someone I would look to try and sidegrade - in terms of fantasy production - or upgrade after a high note.
                He looked pretty poor last year, and the numbers seem to back up the eyes in this case.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Some other observations:
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>
                        The receiving production of both Jones and Pollard seems to depend on touchdowns.
                        Makes me a little nervous that their numbers will dip a little this year, but I do think
                        both are quality fantasy assets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sanders did not get much receiving work last year. Makes you wonder if that will cap Swift in the Eagles receiving game,
                        but so far he has benefitted from quite a bit of work in passing situations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I wonder if either ETN or K9 can develop a stronger receiving game. 
                        It would make them incredible fantasy assets. As of now, it limits their ceiling.
                        Although, ETN has improved dramatically this season with 27 catches on
                        35 targets for 266 yards. Last season, he had 35 catches on 45 targets for 316 yards. 
                        He is one of the most exciting running back assets to own.

                Our final tier breakdown:
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li><b>Cluster 0:</b> Backs that will not produce via the air.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 1:</b> The tier just below CMC and Ekeler.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 2:</b> These backs give a little receiving production, but they will not be fantasy relevant mainly through the air.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 3:</b> CMC and Ekeler.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 4:</b> Middle of the pack receiving backs who have a nose for the endzone.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 5:</b> McKinnon.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 6:</b> Good receiving backs who struggle to score receiving touchdowns.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Again, Swift in Kamara are in that tier just behind CMC and Ekeler. Both have
                performed well this year, but I suspect their price is still worth paying for.

                The rest is much of the same at this point, so I'll leave the analysis at that for this post.

            <h2 class="h2-blog">Summary</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Thanks to those who have made it this far! I hope you enjoyed this deeper dive in the running back position.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Keep an eye out for the next piece, which will be part three on backs. I will look at the running back landscape via tiers 
                in regards to both rushing and receiving stats, to try and get a final, comprehensive picture of the position.

                As always, the recap:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>For those still stuck in a dinosaur mindset, the game has changed. Backs who mainly (or only) produce via receiving numbers can be more than effective fantasy assets.</li>
                <li>ETN flashed last year and is getting much better as an all around back. He's still a buy for me, as ETN appears to be a cornerstone going forward. Being tied to that offense for a while is very appealing.</li>
                <li>Swift and Monty were my buys heading into this season. The situations they have inherited are out of this world. Buy if you still can.</li>
                <li>Kamara and Conner turned into buys for me after looking at the numbers. Kamara is the budget Ekeler for contenders. Conner is the budget Kamara. Buy before it's too late.</li>
                <li>Pierce is a really interesting buy low. He should be cheap and on volume alone might be serviceable as an RB2 for a contender, but Singletary and Pierce's performances this year make buying him risky.</li>
                <li>Raschaad White does not pass the eye test for me. Sell if you can. Wait until he puts together a few PPR performances and then package him for someone better.</li>
                <li>Taylor is a screaming buy low in my eyes. Tough situation this year, and injuries are still lingering. The future with AR looks bright, could be a smart buy (later in the season/the offseason) for a rebuilder who is very close to turning it around.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
