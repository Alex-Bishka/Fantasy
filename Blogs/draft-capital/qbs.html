            <h1>Draft Capital and Quarterback Success</h1>


            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <div>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>It usually isn't worth drafting a QB who doesn't have round 1 capital - QBs drafted in round one have at least one QB1 season in their careers about 55.56% of the time. The next closest hit rate is 33.33% from round two and seven (note, seven has a really small sample size).</li>
                    <li>QBs in round two historically hit at least a QB1 or QB2 season 55.56% of the time. It's slightly better than a coin toss to get at least a usable fantasy season out of these players.</li>
                    <li>94.4% (17/18) of QBs that post a sack rate of under 8.7% and are over 6.5 adjusted air yards in their rookie season post a QB1 season. The 1/18 QB is Mac Jones - the only one taken after pick 10 and named a started from day one. This builds off the work from this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/comments/1bk3x5i/with_2_stats_you_could_correctly_predict_95_of_qb/">Reddit post</a> - I am simply changing the definition of success from a second contract to at least one QB1 finish.</li>
                    <li>If QBs fail the sack rate threshold, their bust rate is around 65%, so a QB is not doomed to fail if they have a sack rate of 8.7% or higher in their rookie year. However, depending on how one classifies Bortles, Fields and Smith, the bust rate could increase to 80%.</li>
                    <li>If a QB passes the sack rate threshold, but fails the adjusted air yards threshold, things become more murky. The bust rate is around 53.3%, again, using at least one QB1 season as a success metric. However, we if are narrower with what we call a success - filter out Vince Young, Mark Sanchez, Josh Freeman, Joe Flacco, and Daniel Jones, as these players either had super short careers or rarely put up QB1 seasons - the bust rate increases to 70%.</li>
                </ul>

                    Welcome to another draft capital analysis piece! 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Like in the <a href="/Blogs/draft-capital/wrs.html">wide receiver version</a>, our goal is to see any patterns related to draft capital 
                    for QBs and their success in fantasy football. This serves as preliminary analysis for an upcoming model, it is a way for us to develop some
                    intuition for what may matter for a predictive model.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, in addition to this analysis, I will be building off of this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/comments/1bk3x5i/with_2_stats_you_could_correctly_predict_95_of_qb/">insightful Reddit post</a>,
                    which shows how with sack rate and adjusted yards gained you can predict which rookies are going to be successful at a very high rate.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Before diving in, I do want to mention that the data includes drafts from the year 2000; however, similar to the wide receiver piece, my 
                    data source has some missing information about earlier drafts during this time. As a result of that, and using active players, these 
                    percentages are not going to be exact. Nonetheless, they should serve as a historical barometer of how QBs tend to pan out.
                </p>
            </div>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">Fantasy Success By Round</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Firstly, we must define fantasy success. For QBs, we will say being successful is posting at hitting a QB2 season at least once in their career.
                    Admittedly, this is a low bar, but that standard means that player can be started at least one season in their career, thus having 
                    some fantasy use. To clarify, a player will be in the "Best Season Tier" of 1 if they had one or more QB1 seasons, but they will not be double 
                    counted in other tiers. So, a player with a "Best Season Tier" of 2 will not have finished as a QB1 in their career; however, they may have multiple 
                    QB2 finishes.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    So, breaking down the data by round and fantasy success, we see the following success rates for QBs:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 700px; height: 360px;" src="/Analysis/interactive-2.0/QB/draft-capital/success-by-round-table.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The first round offers by far the best sample size, and success rates. About 55.56% of QBs drafted in round 1 hit a QB1
                    season, and an additional 19.04% offer at least one QB2 season.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The success rate of second round QBs drastically declines, with only six of 18 players hitting a QB1 season, and an additional four 
                    providing at least one QB2 season. This round essentially is a dart throw as to whether or not a usable fantasy season occurs. 
                    Round three is worse, but still offers some hope. The rest of the draft really turns into a crapshoot.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    A summarized version of the success and bust rates by round:

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Most QBs are drafted in the first round, and that's were the gold tends to be.
                </p>
                

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    For those who are more visual learners, the following plots below show the data as bar graphs. The first highlights 
                    Success Rate vs. Draft Round:

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The takeaway is that, if drafting blindly, it's not really worth grabbing a QB in a rookie draft after round two. Furthermore, 
                    it is historically safer to invest more significantly on round one QBs, as they post, by far, the highest success rate (of providing 
                    at least one QB1 season).
                </p>
            </div>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">Fantasy Success By Position</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, I want to dive further into the success rate of round one. However, I also want to narrow success rate to having at least one QB1
                    season, as drafting a first round QB in dynasty drafts usually requires strong capital - at least in super flex leagues. So, it isn't
                    worthwhile to us if a QB doesn't offer us that kind of fantasy production.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    We start by breaking down round one into six positional buckets: those drafted from 1-3, 4-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, and 21-32:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">

                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Interestingly enough, the 4-5 range offers the best success rate, but with a sample size of 4 this might just be noise. QBs taken in 
                    the top five picks hit a QB1 season quite frequently, especially compared to those outside of the top five. It appears risky to draft 
                    a QB that was not taken as a top five pick. As a result, it makes me wonder if it is worth the price to draft other first round quarterbacks,
                    and on a blind evaluation, I would say probably not.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, in an attempt to get better sample sizes for our buckets, let's reorganize how our position ranges to 1-5, 6-10, and 11-32, as 
                    each of these groups has a sample size of at least 10:

                    This more clearly shows the gap between the QBs drafted in the top five, versus the rest of the first round. From almost a 70% hit rate
                    of QBs taken in the top five to an average of 45% for the rest of the first round, unless there are a lot of green flags about a prospect,
                    it seems like a bad idea to take a shot on them in a dynasty rookie draft, assuming the player is going in round one, or the first half or 
                    so of round two.

                    Again, unless there's a lot to love about a prospect, it doesn't seem worth drafting a QB in dynasty if they were drafted outside of the top 
                    five in the NFL draft, maybe the top ten. Then again, if there's a lot to love about a QB prospect, it seems unlikely they fall outside of

                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/comments/1bk3x5i/with_2_stats_you_could_correctly_predict_95_of_qb/">Reddit post</a>.
                    This post found that there is a high success rate, if a QB passes two thresholds in their rookie year: 1) a sack rate of under 8.7%
                    and 2) an adjusted air yards gained per pass attempt value above 6.5.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I made two changes from the original post: who is included in the data set and what we consider success. I only include players drafted 
                    in round one, and I define success as having at least one QB1 finish, i.e. finishing as QB12 overall or better.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Of the QBs in my data set taken since 1999, only 18 QBs satisfy both conditions above:

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I have highlighted Mac Jones, as he is the only player that passes both thresholds and has not posted a QB1 season.
                    Mac Jones is the only failure on our success list. That statement comes with an asterisk, as it is still 
                    possible, albeit unlikely, for Mac Jones to turn things around.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The only outlier I could find about him amongst this group of QBs, is that of the players 
                    taken after 10th overall - Culpepper, Pennington, Cutler, Rodgers, Watson, Jackson, Jones, and Love -
                    Jones is the only one to be announced the starter on opening day.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    There might be something else in his college stats as well, but I am still in the process of obtaining college 
                    data, so I have not been able to do any real digging there yet. Although this point I'm making here 
                    is very nit-picky, and might just be a coincidence, rather than a real point of separation.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    So, 17 of 18 QBs that passed both thresholds in their rookie year have gone on to produce a QB1 fantasy season. That is a hit 
                    rate of 94.4%. That's a pretty good filter.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, if a QB fails either threshold, the situation is not catastrophic. This is the list of QBs with a QB1 finish who had a sack rate 
                    at or over 8.7%:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 650px; height: 590px;" src="/Analysis/interactive-2.0/QB/draft-capital/fail-one-qbs.html"></iframe>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The QBs highlighted in yellow all finished as a QB1 at least once. So, by that measure of success, the bust rate here is 65% and the 
                    success rate is 35%. Now, if are a little pickier and remove Fields, Bortles, and Alex Smith, the bust rate increases to 80%. Now,
                    why would we remove these players? Alex Smith only had one QB1 finish in his long career. Justin Fields also only has one QB1 finish in 
                    his young career, but based on how the trade market looked for him this offseason he looks like a backup now. Finally, while Bortles did 
                    have two top ten finishes in his career, it only lasted five seasons.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    While that is less encouraging, it does show hope for value retention. So, if a rookie QB does not meet this threshold, there still is a 
                    decent chance that he could manage some hype for his value. That being said, it is not ideal for a rookie QB to have a sack rate at or 
                    over 8.7%.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, if a QB passes the first threshold and fails the second, success rate appears to be murkier:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 650px; height: 840px;" src="/Analysis/interactive-2.0/QB/draft-capital/fail-two-qbs.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Again, the QBs highlighted in yellow had at least one QB1 finish. As things stand, the hit rate is 46.67%, which yields a bust rate 
                    of 53.33%.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, there are five names which I can argue should not be included as successes: Vince Young, Mark Sanchez, Josh Freeman, Joe Flacco, 
                    and Daniel Jones. All of these QBs have either had really short career, or they've only finished as a QB1 once - some are unfortunate enough to 
                    accomplish both. Removing those names changes the success rate to 30% and the bust rate to 70%.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Technically, Tua would also be a bust by these 
                    standards, but I believe he has shown enough in Miami to earn the benefit of the doubt when it comes to getting his second QB1 season.

            <h2 class="h2-blog">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I want to end on this interesting note. If we go back and take a look at our 
                    successful QBs that did not hit both thresholds, under the noted restrictive lens, we end up with the following players:
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Trevor Lawrence</li>
                    <li>Tua Tagovailoa</li>
                    <li>Josh Allen</li>
                    <li>Carson Wentz</li>
                    <li>Ryan Tannehill</li>
                    <li>Andrew Luck</li>
                    <li>Matthew Stafford</li>
                    <li>Eli Manning</li>
                    <li>Carson Palmer</li>
                    <li>Donovan McNabb</li>
                    <li>Mike Vick</li>
                    <li>Ben Roethlisberger</li>
                    <li>Jared Goff</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The only QB above who was picked outside of the top ten is Big Ben. Josh Allen and Tannehill are the only other two outside of the top 
                    five.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    To me, this highlights how much of a crapshoot QB success is outside of the top ten, even top five picks.
                    If a QB fails to hit both thresholds their rookie year and they are drafted outside of the top five picks in round one, 
                    their chance of success is essentially 0%.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, the big question is how can we utilize college stats to accurately predict sack rate and adjusted yards gained in the NFL?
                    The answer to that question will likely bridge the gap between college to NFL evaluation, and allow us to confidently draft QB
                    prospects. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    That will have to be a piece for another time. I leave you with that question to ponder.
