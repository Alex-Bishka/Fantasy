            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Rushing stats are generally predictable and reliable, albeit less so than passing stats.</li>
                    <li>Rushing touchdowns are a much more variable stat than passing touchdowns, across the board.</li>
                    <li>Yards per carry is a very noisy stat.</li>
                    <li>
                        Running backs have much less predictability compared to quarterbacks, both generally and at a starter level.
                        Applying filters to running backs to get only fantasy relevant players produces ugly predictors - it results in all noise.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bellcows still do exist, but good luck finding them with the noisy running back landscape.</li>
                    <li>Rushing quarterbacks have some quite predictable rushing stats: rushing yardage and carries.</li>
                    <li>Rushing touchdowns for rushing quarterbacks are far less predictable than for passing touchdowns.</li>
                    <li>There isn't a rushing stat that is reliable, year-over-year, that also serves as a decent predictor for the fantasy production of backs.</li>
                    <li>While rushing quarterbacks have more reliable year-over-year rushing stats, the same stats do not serve as very reliable predictors for fantasy production.</li>

                    In the following analysis I look into how <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('sticky-definition')">sticky</a>
                    rushing stats are, primarily focusing on season totals.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The optimistic goal is to find stats that serve as strong and consistent predictors for rushing success, for both quarterbacks
                    and running backs. Practically speaking, I shall be surveying the landscape of rushing numbers in hopes of discovering patterns (or lack thereof).

                    This investigation is a continuation upon research into how replicable (fantasy relevant) football stats
                    are year-over-year. In order to grasp the bigger picture better, I encourage you to checkout

                    One last note, before diving in, the data to make the correlation heat maps and scatter plots is from 2012-2022, unless stated otherwise.

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        From an unfiltered, general perspective, there is less to rely upon with rushing numbers compared to
                        <a href="https://alex-bishka.github.io/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/QB/stability-passing/unfiltered.html">passing stats</a>.

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        That being said, there still is some strong year-to-year correlation with rushing yards (0.74), carries (0.76), and fantasy points (0.74).
                        Touchdowns are far less reliable, with a year-over-year correlation of 0.60. This matches the expectation: rushing touchdowns are
                        a rather fluky stat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        To get a better sense of the data we are working with, the following scatter plot shows the strongest year-to-year correlation from the previous

                        There is a lot of noise towards the bottom left of the graph. Most of those data points offer little value, in terms of helping us find
                        stats to serve as strong predictors of fantasy performance.

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        We will need to apply a filter to obtain information more relevant to fantasy
                        production. However, it is nice to know that, generally speaking, rushing numbers are not totally random - in fact, the fantasy relevant ones,
                        are somewhat-to-very (positively) predictable.

                        Our first filter will be to look exclusively at the running back position.

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        The following heat map displays the season-to-season correlation numbers:

                        While correlations from year-to-year are definitely weaker, there is more cross-correlation amongs stats. To me, this shows that running back
                        numbers across the board are moderately predictable, and having just one (outisde of yards-per-carry) can paint the majority of the picture.

                        I want to highlight that rushing touchdowns, year-over-year, have a correlation of 0.53. Not random, but also not a strong predictor either.
                        This is far worse from the general data set for passing touchdowns (the correlation was 0.74). The numbers continue to reflect the story line
                        I have been told.

                        Outside of touchdowns, pretty much every correlation across the board is worse. I guess there's a little safety in knowing that your bellcow back probably won't regress much
                        when it comes to scoring touchdowns? The sample size is 77 players too, so I would not discount these results.

                        The bar graph above shows the number of bellcows each season from 2013-2022. Again, I define a bellcow as a running back with more than 200
                        carries in consecutive seasons. So, the 11 players that appear on the first bar also had over 200 carries in 2012.

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        I find this graph to be interesting, as it seems to me that the death of the bell cow has been exaggerated.
                        From 2013-2017 there were 42 running back seasons that qualified as "bellcow workload". This number has diminished from 2018-2022 to 35 such "bellcow workload" seasons.

                        The rushing stats are not quite as predictable across the board for quarterbacks, compared to

                        However, quarterbacks seem to be quite reliable in the rushing yardage department, with a super strong correlation of 0.77.
                        This is only slightly less than the correlation for passing yards year-over-year (which was 0.79), from the unfiltered data set.

                        Quarterbacks also have a stronger correlation with carries and fantasy points season-to-season, at 0.79 and 0.70, respectively.

                    While probably not that useful for fantasy predictions, another interesting stat I noticed is that rushing quarterbacks (quarterbacks

                    Combine that with the fact that rushing quarterbacks average 5.24 yards a carry, compared to 4.30 for bellcows, and I can see why everyone wants
                    a rushing quarterback. Additionally, I figure this adds to the narrative that the bellcow is dead.

                    For example, we saw that rushing yards vs. rushing yards last had a correlation of 0.74, when looking at the

                    Now, if rushing yards correlates strongly with fantasy production, this would mean that rushing yardage would be a pretty good indicator of fantasy performance.

                    Well, ideally, we want to find stats that are predictable and positively so (sticky stats) from year-to-year, that
                    also contribute (significantly) to fantasy production.

                    The heat maps below show the correlation between fantasy points (current and previous season) and rushing stats that had at least 
                    a moderate correlation (at least 0.40) with themselves on a year-to-year basis.

                    I find it strange that fumbles might end up being the best predictor for fantasy points, from a rushing perspective.
                    I believe these strange results are coming from the grouping of running backs and quarterbacks.

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Filtering the data for only running backs yields the following graph:

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        There are far more stats that have at least moderate year-to-year correlation and also correlate well with fantasy points in eiher the current
                        or previous season. The three strongest predictors, and they are very strong, appear to be rushing yards, successful plays, and carries (curret or previous seasons).
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Furthermore, each stat has a decently strong correlation with itself, year-over-year. 0.64 for rushing yards, 0.65 for carries, and 0.65 for successful plays.
                        Exciting to see that rushing stats for all running backs are predictable.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        What becomes disappointing, is that there is no stat that has at least a moderate correlation (0.40) with itself on a year-to-year basis and
                        a moderate correlation with fantasy points simultaneously. It seems fair to expect backs to improve over time, but once they receive a fantasy relevant
                        workload (over 100 carries), all bets are off. This is a point I intend to revisit later, with other statistical techniques, to see if there
                        might be something useful lurking under the surface.

                        Let's take a look at only quarterbacks now:

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        None of these predictors are particularly strong. Perhaps the situation will improve as we remove the noise from quarterbacks who do not rush much.

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        Applying a filter of over 20 carries to quarterbacks:

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        It's a little better, but still not spectacular. Finally, the filter of over 40 carries applied to quarterbacks:

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        This is the best yet! The correlations for fantasy points and successful plays, as well as fantasy points and carries is moderate-to-strong.
                        Additionally, carries has an okay year-to-year correlation with itself of 0.47. The same correlation for successful plays is 0.43. Not great,
                        not bad.

                    <p class="blog-p-tag">
                        I would say that on this evidence, in context with the rest of this research, rushing numbers for quarterbacks are sustainable year-over-year and
                        for fantasy success. However, <a href="https://alex-bishka.github.io/Fantasy/Blogs/qbs-sticky-per-game#further-exploration-0">passing stats</a>
                        are still more reliable on a year-to-year basis, and as indicators of fantasy success.

                    On that note, I'll wrap up the analysis with the main takeaways:
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Rushing stats are generally predictable and reliable, albeit less so than passing stats.</li>
                    <li>Rushing touchdowns are a much more variable stat than passing touchdowns, across the board.</li>
                    <li>Yards per carry is a very noisy stat.</li>
                    <li>
                        Running backs have much less predictablity compared to quarterbacks, both generally and at a starter level.
                        Applying filters to running backs to get only fantasy relevant players produces ugly predictors - it results in all noise.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bellcows still do exist, but good luck finding them with the noisy running back landscape.</li>
                    <li>Rushing quarterbacks have some quite predictable rushing stats: rushing yardage and carries.</li>
                    <li>Rushing touchdowns for rushing quarterbacks are far less predictable than for passing touchdowns.</li>
                    <li>There isn't a rushing stat that is reliable, year-over-year, that also serves as a decent predictor for the fantasy production of backs.</li>
                    <li>While rushing quarterbacks have more reliable year-over-year rushing stats, the same stats do not serve as very reliable predictors for fantasy production.</li>
                </ul>
