                    What is the first pick in your upcoming rookie draft worth to you? No, I'm no talking about
                    player or draft capital value. I don't want to hear what in addition to Caleb or MHJ add up to
                    JJet. I'm talking about what punishment are you willing to endure for the 1.01?
                    How often has the punishment been worth the reward?

            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I just finished the second year of my East vs. West coast dynasty league. Our famous league, filled
                    with rich rivalry is called <i>Dynasty</i> (yes, I think we need new commissioners too!).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The <i>Dynasty</i> - terrible league name - has had two seasons filled with twists and turns.
                    Two different teams acquired bragging rights over the rest of the league. One team has had the pleasure
                    of finishing as the winner (or should I say loser?) of the toilet bowl in back-to-back seasons.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I am that team. I am the proud owner of a team deep in the ashes of a burnt phoenix (a.k.a. I'm 
                    delusional and think I can contend in year three, but realistically am rebuilding hard after a 
                    shite startup draft).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    So, how has life been at the bottom of the barrel? Well, I have some exciting pieces, like Herbert,
                    Stroud and Pittman, amongst others, but has my tanking been worth the price?
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I mean... how bad can a punishment really be?
                </p>

            <h2 class="h2-blog">The Punishment(s)</h2>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    My league has a fun trait: we choose the punishment during the offseason.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    That's right! That means that any lucky losers or tankers - like me, as a randomly chosen example -
                    don't know how much of their soul (or pride) they have sold until after the 1.01 has been claimed.

                    Following my TANK FOR BIJAN campaign, I was rewarded with the task of creating an OnlyFans.
                    For those of you who are getting excited, please settle down. The account exists, but I, thankfully,
                    have not had to post (explicit) content. In fact, the account is currently empty. Perhaps one day
                    I will post some NSFW fantasy football content - like my 60 point championship win in my redraft
                    league.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Well... I wouldn't know... I traded away the 1.01 for Olave and JSN. Awkward.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, is the 1.01 worth it for this upcoming draft? Well this was moments before disaster struck:

                    Let that sink in... as if suffering from that fandom couldn't get any worse. The Packers jersey is the

                    One more detail. This is me. Me for one month. Me at work. Me at restaurants. Me at airports.

                    Our league originally agreed that a reset would occur after a team won three titles (yea, yea, I'm
                    taking that up with the commissioners). Well, what about three (consecutive) toilet bowls?

                    I don't know if I can take another punishment.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Oh, one more thing. The dye was done by a salon, and it ran me about $300 plus tip. It was a great job
                    by them, but maybe that payment was the real punishment.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Time will tell, but I can say one thing for certain: the league has strongly deterred me from future
                    tanking. This is especially the case, since punishments are going to get more creative and worse.
                    Not to mention, in a completely unrelated note, I don't own my own first round pick next year.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Hopefully MHJ or Caleb can help turn this franchise around. I eagerly await their contributions for the 
                    2024 season, and will be posting my worst to first documentary this time next year (more realistically
                    my three-peat toilet bowl achievement). I need whoever I pick to be special in fantasy.

                    Anyway, I hope y'all enjoyed this post. It's a change-up from the analysis posts I normally write, but I
