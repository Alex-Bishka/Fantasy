            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    This post serves as a quick extension to my previous one, <a href="https://alex-bishka.github.io/Fantasy/Blogs/rushing-sticky-season-totals">Rushing Sticky Stats</a>
                    and is inspired by the discussion on my previous <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/comments/18n87a0/how_sticky_are_rushing_stats/">Reddit post</a>. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The question we are trying to answer: <b>how stable are yards per carry (ypc)?</b>
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    From the previous <a href="https://alex-bishka.github.io/Fantasy/Blogs/rushing-sticky-season-totals">examination</a>, 
                    ypc is most definitely not a <a href="https://alex-bishka.github.io/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/RB/stability-rushing/season/simple-rb.html">sticky stat</a>, 
                    as it frequently had a low correlation with itself, year-over-year (0.15 in the heat map linked). While ypc doesn't increase year-over-year, it could be possible
                    that this stat doesn't change much, or fluctuates crazily.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The graphs generated below to try and answer this question, display ypc on the y-axis
                    against the sum of carries in the current season and previous season on the x-axis.
                    Each line on the graph is created by a minimum game threshold.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    For a player's stats to qualify
                    for the data for a line in the line graph, they must have played <i>n</i> minimum games in each
                    of the current and previous seasons. So, if a player had 10 games and 4 games in the current and 
                    previous season, respectively, their stats would contribute only to the line labeled as 'Min Games: 4'.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The last remarks before diving into the graphs: the data used was from 2012-2022 and focuses only on running
                    backs.
                </p>
            </div>

            
            <h2 class="h2-blog">YPC is Noisy</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The three graphs below are the ones that I find the most useful to answering this question:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1200px; height: 700px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/RB/stability-rushing/ypc-stability/ypc-v-carries-2-8-13-16.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    This first one above does a great job of showcasing how noisy yards per carry are when backs have less than 100 carries 
                    and barely play. The ypc varies wildly from -8 to almost 9 yards per carry. This is highlighted very well by the blue and 
                    red line (min games of 2 and 8, respectively).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Furthermore, the yo-yoing decreases as the number of games increases, highlighted best by the green and purple line
                    (min games of 13 and 16 respectively). When taking a look at the ypc over 300 carries, the range is from about 2.92 to 5.60 yards
                    per carry.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    If we narrow our focus to over 500 total carries in the two year time span, the range decreases even more, to about 3.18 to 5.45
                    yards per carry.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The two graphs below do an even better job of show casing the difference in the range of ypc as the number of minimum games increases,
                    and consequently, the sum of carries:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1200px; height: 700px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/RB/stability-rushing/ypc-stability/ypc-v-carries-4-6-8-10-12.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1200px; height: 700px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/RB/stability-rushing/ypc-stability/ypc-v-carries-3-5-7-9-11.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Despite ypc stabilizing for, what I would call, starting backs, I would still argue that the final range of 3.18 to 5.45 yards per carry
                    still shows how noisy the stat is. This paints a clearer picture on what the lack of a strong correlation for ypc vs. ypc in the previous year 
                    looks like.
                </p>
            </div>
            

            <h2 class="h2-blog">YPC and Fantasy Performance</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    One more thing I was interested in exploring in this piece, was the idea that once a running back declines, from
                    a ypc perspective, their fantasy career also tended to decline, or completely falls off a cliff.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Looking at graphing both ypc and <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('fantasy-points-normalized', 150)">normalized fantasy points</a>
                    (over a season) against age, yield the following line graph with the unfiltered running back data:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1200px; height: 550px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/RB/stability-rushing/ypc-stability/ypc-v-age-all.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Not really what I would've expect... yards per carry stays quite constant and the best fantasy seasons seem to occur between the ages
                    of 32-34.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    However, we do need to apply some filters to the data. Let's see what happens when 
                    we apply a filter of being in at least 10 games in a season, to filter out injuries and part-time players:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1200px; height: 550px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/RB/stability-rushing/ypc-stability/ypc-v-age-10-games.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The graph is still not what I expected. I would not expect the peak years for a back in fantasy to be from the ages of 32-34.
                    Furthermore, I am surprised this is occuring with the gradual decline of the ypc numbers.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    However, the sample size is extremely small where the unexpected behavior is occuring. Applying an additional filter, say at least 10 samples per age group,
                    to remove the outliers yields the graph below:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1200px; height: 550px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/RB/stability-rushing/ypc-stability/ypc-v-age-10-games-10-samples.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now at a point where the data makes more sense for fantasy purposes, we see that backs have basically three peaks for fantasy production
                    at the ages of 22, 26 and 28, in order of most to least productive.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Moreover, yards per carry hovers between 4.2 and 4.4 until backs turn 26. From that point, there's a pretty sharp decline in efficiency at 27.
                    The efficiency seems to briefly recover by 29, before plummetting again. I want to point out that the sample size of backs at 29 and 30 is the
                    lowest in the data, so backs that fit into this category appear to be surviving against father time for a bit longer than the majority
                    of their peers. I also want to emphasize that past thirty, there are only a handful of backs that play at least 10 games a year - the graph cuts 
                    off before we hit extremely rare territory.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The last graph I want to highlight adds the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('carries-normalized', 150)">normalized average number of carries</a>, to the graph above:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1200px; height: 550px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/RB/stability-rushing/ypc-stability/ypc-v-age-10-games-10-samples-carries.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The average number of carries also matches the trend from the previous graph. Running backs depreciate as soon as they are drafted, but seriously
                    start to lose value just after 26, before falling off some time between 28 and 30 years old.
                </p>
            </div>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">Summary</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Yards per carry is a noisy stat in pretty much every way you choose to inspect the data. It does stablize a bit more
                    for backs who get more carries, but it still isn't consistent at that point.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    While yards per carry is not a sticky stat, it serves as a decent signal for fantasy performance, along with carries.
                    Once a backs' ypc numbers crash, the end of their fantasy shelf life is likely closing in.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Finally, backs have about three peaks in their career, marked by the ages of 22, 26, and 28 years old.
                    A back's value tends to stay mostly intact up until the second peak at 26, but 28 appears to be a lower
                    peak and a last hurray.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    If you want to maximize the value of back, use them until about 25-26 and then sell. If you're a contender, buying backs
                    in a down year around 26-27 might be a good way to get cheap one-two year rentals.
