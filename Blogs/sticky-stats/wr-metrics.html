            <h2 class="h2-blog">A Cursory Glance</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I want to begin by examining this idea of the "trinity" score. For those unfamiliar with what this metric is,
                    I recommend checking out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bvEd8iMQVo">this video</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    In short, trinity is a metric that is supposed to be predictable and indicative of fantasy performance. It consists
                    of the three following stats: <i>target share</i>, <i>air yards share</i>, and <i>yards after the catch per reception</i>.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    This is what the trinity score, its components, and fantasy points - all normalized - against age look like together on a graph:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1150px; height: 600px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/trinity-starters-by-age.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    For the most part, the components of the trinity score do a good job of mirroring fantasy production.
                    Trinity itself also mirrors fantasy points quite well, even though it's spikes are more subdued.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The trouble maker here is <i>yards after the catch per reception</i>. This makes sense too, as <i>yards after the catch per reception</i>
                    correlates quite poorly with fantasy points: 
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1150px; height: 600px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/trinity-corr-by-age.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    So the question I'm now wondering, is why does trinity score utilize <i>yards after the catch per reception</i>?
                    It appears to be counter-productive as a predictor for how a wide receiver will grow in their career. Does it hold
                    back how strong the correlation between trinity score and fantasy points is? Trinity score does have a 0.80 correlation
                    with fantasy points which is quite strong...
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Maybe it makes a bit more sense if you take a look at the picture by season instead of age:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1150px; height: 600px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/trinity-starters-by-season.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    In this situation, <i>yards after the catch per reception</i> is a far better indicator of fantasy performance from season-to-season
                    at the wide receiver position.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    In fact, it's the best metric when looking at the data from this perspective:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1150px; height: 600px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/trinity-corr-by-season.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I would say this is useful in that it shows how trinity keeps up with fantasy production every year, but 
                    I would be cautious to use this metric on how a wide receiver performs over the course of their career. 
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    It's possible I'm missing something here, as I'm simply aggregating the three components to obtain the trinity value.
                    However, any sort of linear combination would still yield similar results.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I believe what would be a more useful metric, is something that improves upon mirroring fantasy production by age, 
                    as we care about how players will develop in there careers, more than fluctuations in the overall fantasy production
                    of a position group (unless there are drastic changes there).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    That being said, I do want to point out that the correlation of trinity score in previous season and fantasy
                    points in the current season is close to being strong:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1150px; height: 600px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/trinity-fp-corr.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    That's a correlation value of about 0.586.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I want to emphasis that trinity score is a solid metric.
                    The trinity value of a player matches their fantasy performance quite well, and the trinity value of a 
                    previous season is not a bad estimate of fantasy performance in the current season. This means we
                    can 1) expect patterns to hold as players age and 2) use the metric as a decent indicator of player's
                    performance in the upcoming season.
                </p>
            </div>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">A Better Metric?</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The question is, can we come up with a better metric than trinity score, specifically for predicting
                    the career trajectory of a wide receiver?
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    My first attempt at this is to find the set of variables that has the strongest correlation to fantasy
                    points. The assumption I'm making, for now, here is that since most wide receiver stats are sticky from season-to-season
                    (i.e. strong correlation with themselves from year-to-year), we simply need to find the best set of variables
                    to correlate with fantasy points.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Ideally, I would want to run this optimization in an exhuastive fashion. Regerttably, the number of permutations
                    of stats that are fantasy relevant to the wide receiver position is a bit too large for my laptop - we are talking 
                    tens to hundreds of millions of possibilities.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    So, in an effort to intelligently explore the state space, I remove stats that fluctuate from year-to-year, like touchdowns
                    and two-point conversion stats.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The highest correlation with fantasy football from the state space I explored was 0.623:

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    This metric consists of <i>receiving yards</i>, <i>receiving yards after the catch</i>,
                    <i>air yards share</i>, and <i>receiving yards per team pass attempt</i>, all normalized.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    There were almost 30,000 permuations of wide receiver stats that had a correlation of at least 0.61 with fantasy 
                    points, whereas trinity was at 0.586.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    For those curious of how this particular new metric appears against age, when caluclated in the same year as fantasy points:

                    Trinity is thrown on there for comparision. Both metrics become inaccurate at 31 on, but that's likely because there are only 47
                    total seasons of wide receivers who have played at least 10 games in season X and X + 1, during this time period.

                    Again, the new metric follows fantasy production much more closely than trinity score does.
                    It seems that our assumption held pretty well.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    So, while trinity score is a useful metric, and pretty easy to calculate, I would argue there are better options out there
                    for creating a preidictive metric of wide receiver performance. This is one of many that is a stronger option, at least when 
                    keeping things linear.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    For some other options, I'll post the top ten metrics I found that had the best correlation with fantasy points in a season.

            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now that we have this new metric, how does it compare to trinity when it comes to predictive modeling?
                    You would expect that the new metric would perform better given the stronger correlation to fantasy points
                    in the next season, but let's actually examine this.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    We start by creating a
                    <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('multiple-linear-regression')">multiple linear regression (MLR)</a>
                    model. This occurs in a pretty standard fashion, clean the 
                    data, split it into test and train sets, fit the model to the training data, and then evaluate it's performance on
                    the test set.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The results of the model can be seen below:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1150px; height: 600px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/new-metric-mlr.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    On first glance, the model appears to do quite poorly, especially on the more elite performers.
                    However, if we instead think about the "success" of the model as guessing in the right direction,
                    there is some light at the end of the tunnel.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The green dots on the scatter plot represent points that were predicted in the same direction as the actual 
                    change in fantasy points. In other words, the model was correct at guessing an increase or decrease of a
                    player's fantasy production, but, likely, incorrect at how much said change was.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Likewise, the red dots on the scatter plot represent points that were predicted in the wrong direction, compared
                    to the actual direction of change in fantasy production.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    When using these metrics, we see that the model has a success rate of about 63% on these 146 samples.
                    I want to note that this particular model is worse at predicting higher end fantasy performers - as observed
                    from the graph - with a success rate of 56.2% there (I define this as at least 101 actual fantasy points in a season).
                    For those under the threshold, the accuracy was around 68.3%.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Based on the graph, a clear limitation of the model seems to be predictability range.
                    The highest prediction is around 175 points. That's problematic and is something I need to look into
                    further.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, if we compare this result to a model that uses trinity as the predictive metric instead, we get the following instead:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1150px; height: 600px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/trinity-mlr.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    If you don't really see a noticeable difference, that's because there is not much change here.
                    Distances from the expected values are larger and directional success is worse.
                    So, yes, this version of the model is worse, but not by much.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Taking a look at our directional "success" stats, this model had an overall success rate of 61.6%.
                    Again, the model is better at predicting the production of less relevant players, with a success rate of 63.4% (players
                    who had under 101 actual fantasy points) and worse at predicting the production of more relevant players, with a success rate 
                    of 59.4% (player who had at least 101 actual fantasy points).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    So, our expectation has been met, at least when it comes to a linear regression model.
                    Trinity score is a solid metric, and while not the best, it is not far from better metrics.
