            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Tight end stats appear to correlate quite well. This is especially true when looking at starters.</li>
                    <li>
                        Starting tight ends, on average, peak in fantasy production by 27.
                        Unfortunately that correlation is not always positive.
                    </li>
                    <li>The lowest point of a starting tight end's career appears to be between the ages of 28-30.</li>
                    <li>
                        Those that remain starters after 30 have a decent production bump at 31.
                        There are too few samples to examine beyond that age.
                    </li>
                    <li>Most starters are between the ages of 26-31.</li>
                    <li>
                        2023 was the best year of tight end fantasy production of all the years I looked into (2012-2023).
                        This is a golden era of tight ends, and one that lacks a dominant player at the top.
                    </li>

                    Once again, the goal is to find out if the position group has any stats that are positively predictable
                    that can also be used as indicators of fantasy performance.

                    Without further ado, let's dive in!
                </p>
            </div>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">A Cursory Glance</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Starting with a correlation heat map on the unfiltered tight end data:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 800px; height: 650px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/Basic-Receiving-Stat-Correlations.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    There is pretty good correlation across the board. This heat map is actually quite similar to the same one
                    for <a href="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/Basic-Receiving-Stat-Correlations">wide receivers</a>,
                    which bodes well for tight end predictability.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    However, if we examine the scatter plot that highlights the strongest self correlating year-to-year stat, <i>receiving yards</i>
                    vs. <i>receiving yards last</i>, we can see some noise:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1100px; height: 650px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/tight-end-basic-Receiving-Yards-vs.-Receiving-Yards-Last.html"></iframe>
                </div>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Applying a filter (10 games played in each of season X and X - 1) to the data, to get a proxy of more fantasy relevant data, yields the following 
                    correlation heat map:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 800px; height: 650px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/Basic-Receiving-Stat-Correlations-(10-Games-Current-and-10-games-Past-Season).html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Again, very encouraging how high the correlation values are. They are all strong, even if the values are on
                    the weaker side of strong. Moreover, this heat map compares really well to the <a href="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/Basic-Receiving-Stat-Correlations-(Games=10-and-Games-Last=10).html">same one</a> applied to
                    wide receivers. Tight end might actually be a somewhat predictable position.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Before we get ahead of ourselves, here's the scatter plot of <i>receiving yards</i> vs. <i>receiving yards last</i>, to display what 
                    our filtered data looks like:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1100px; height: 650px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/tight-end-basic-10-games-Receiving-Yards-vs.-Receiving-Yards-Last.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    This filtered version of the data set is better, but it's still not a great representation of potentially fantasy relevant
                    tight ends.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    So, let's apply a stronger one. In addition to the previous filter, they must also be the starter in consecutive seasons:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 800px; height: 650px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/Basic-Receiving-Stat-Correlations-(10-Game-Threshold-and-Starter).html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Again, very encouraging signs, as most correlation values are quite strong. I also want to emphazise that
                    this closely follows the
                    <a href="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/Basic-Receiving-Stat-Correlations-(Games=10-and-Games-Last=10-and-Starter).html">same filter on wide receivers</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    However, we have to ask the question - what does our data set look like now?
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Well, the strongest self correlating
                    year-to-year stat, <i>receiving yards</i> vs. <i>receiving yards last</i> (again), has a scatter plot that looks
                    like this:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1100px; height: 650px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/tight-end-basic-10-games-starter-Receiving-Yards-vs.-Receiving-Yards-Last.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I would say this gives us a solid picture of the starting tight end landscape. Not all of it is fantasy relevant, but 
                    tight ends who start are quite likely to improve from year-to-year, in a similar vain to wide receivers.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    One final detail I want to point out: receiving touchdowns for tight ends are pretty erratic, similar to touchdowns for 
                    the other position groups.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The following scatter plot shows <i>receiving touchdowns</i> vs. <i>receiving touchdowns last</i> for the strictest 
                    filter:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1100px; height: 650px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/tight-end-basic-10-games-starter-Receiving-Tds-vs.-Receiving-Tds-Last.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    As expected, touchdowns are a fluky stat for tight ends.
                </p>
            </div>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">Digging Deeper</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Taking a deeper dive at the correlations with basic stats, I noticed a bit of an age 'gap'.
                    Note, this section continues with the strongest filter we applied in the previous section.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    It appears that young (we define young as a player who is 28 or younger in season X) tight ends
                    have inconsistent growth:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 800px; height: 650px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/Basic-Receiving-Stat-Correlations-(10-Game-+-Starter-Threshold-and-Young).html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The correlations in the heat map above are weaker than all of the values in the heat maps from the
                    previous section.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, if we take a look at old (we define old as a player who is 28 or older in season X - 1) tight ends,
                    a different story occurs:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 800px; height: 650px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/Basic-Receiving-Stat-Correlations-(10-Game-+-Starter-Threshold-and-Old).html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    This set of tight ends has strong correlation values across the board. I would say this matches
                    the idea that tight ends typcially take a few seasons to mature and are in their 
                    prime around the age of 28. However, there is more to this story in the
                    <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('fantasy-relevance?-0', 10)">Fantasy Relevance?</a> section.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Before moving on, I wanted to point out what the average depth chart position was by age:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1100px; height: 600px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/depth-chart-v-age.html"></iframe>
                </div>

                    It seems that we get the majority of our starting tight ends from 26-31. Again this backs the narrative
                    that tight ends take some time to mature - but, again, there is some contradictory information in the next
                    section.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    After all this exploration, we have to ask ourselves: what matters in regards to fantasy production?
                    Which stats, that are predictable year-to-year, are also good indicators of fantasy performance?
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Well, the bar graph below highlights this information for our strictest filter,
                    by displaying the correlation of stats (used in this research) to themselves and to fantasy points (PPR):
                </p>

                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The bar graph above sorts the stats from highest self correlation (left) to lowest self correlation (right).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    It's a bit hard to garner information from the bar graph above, so let's focus on stats that have
                    correlation values of at least 0.5 in both cases:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 1100px; height: 600px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/TE/stability/season/correlation-bar-advanced-stats-focused.html"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Those are some pretty strong correlations. Furthermore, these results are somewhat similar to the
                    <a href="/Fantasy/Blogs/sticky-stats/wr-sticky-season-totals#fantasy-relevance-0">correlation bar graph for wide receivers</a>.
                    This offers us some options for creating a useful predictive metric.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    We can start by taking a look at the three most self correlating stats - <i>wopr_y</i>, <i>ay_sh</i>, and <i>ay_sh</i> - 
                    on a plot with fantasy points (PPR version), against age.
                    Additionally, let's plot the combination of these three strong self correlating stats, and call it
                    <i>new-metric</i>. This yields the following plot:
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    This appears to be a pretty great approximation of the fantasy career of a tight end. One interesting subtlty that
                    I would like to point out: tight ends appear to have their lowest fantasy peaks during the ages of 28-30.
                    A little counter to the information we've already explored.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    However, the graph is consistent with stronger correlation values for older tight ends, it's just that
                    the direction of change is more negative or neutral, than positive. Based on this evidence, evaluating
                    the tight end position is harder. Young tight ends don't reliably improve, and prime (or older) tight 
                    ends stagnate or decline.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The metric also seems to be pretty consistent on a season-to-season basis:

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    It is a bit worse than the career trajectory graph, but I would still argue the <i>new-metric</i> is sufficient.
                    That's unfortunate for being able to predict reliably good and improving fantasy tight ends.

                    It is hard to determine which tight ends will become and stay reliable for fantasy purposes.
                    However, this year was the best tight end production across the top 12 options of the years
                    in my analysis:

                    This is a golden era of tight ends, despite the apparent loss of the dominant top dog: Kelce.
                    I think that most teams in most leagues should be able to require a relevant starter with a future,
                    and likely without breaking the bank.

                    To those who made it this far, I appreciate you greatly! Please enjoy the recap, once more:

                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Tight end stats appear to correlate quite well. This is especially true when looking at starters.</li>
                    <li>
                        Starting tight ends, on average, peak in fantasy production by 27.
                        Unfortunately that correlation is not always positive.
                    </li>
                    <li>The lowest point of a starting tight end's career appears to be between the ages of 28-30.</li>
                    <li>
                        Those that remain starters after 30 have a decent production bump at 31.
                        There are too few samples to examine beyond that age.
                    </li>
                    <li>Most starters are between the ages of 26-31.</li>
                    <li>
                        2023 was the best year of tight end fantasy production of all the years I looked into (2012-2023).
                        This is a golden era of tight ends, and one that lacks a dominant player at the top.
