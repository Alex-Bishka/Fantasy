            <h1>Wide Receiver Sticky Stats</h1>


            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Basic wide receiver stats correlate pretty strongly with themselves year-over-year, indicating that 
                        the wide receiver position is a positively predictable one.
                    </li>
                    <li>This more or less holds for starting wide receivers.</li>
                    <li>
                        Receiving touchdowns are the most fluky stat from the basic ones, but are more consistent year-over-year for starting wide receivers (0.40) than 
                        for starting quarterbacks (0.36) and starting running backs (0.25).
                    </li>
                    <li>Starting wide receivers have somewhat strong correlations on most of their basic stats (receptions, targets, receiving yards, etc.).</li>
                    <li>
                        There isn't as strong a drop-off for wide receivers, as for quarterbacks and running backs.
                        As long as a wide receiver is #1 or #2 on the depth chart, they are likely to produce in fantasy.
                        30 and on is when the number of wide receivers as the #1 or #2 becomes rare-to-extinct.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wide receivers have by far the strongest correlating stats, compared to running backs and quarterbacks.
                        This comparison is in regards to the stat against fantasy points and the stat against itself from year-to-year.
                        So, not only are wide receiver stats the most predictable here, but they also are good indicators of fantasy performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Three of the best metrics (I would argue the three best metrics) for wide receiver predictability are:
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('wopr_x')">weighted opportunity rating</a>,
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('ay_sh')">air yards share</a>, and
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('tgt_sh')">target share</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('cushion')">Cushion</a> and
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('separation')">separation</a> have extraordinarily poor correlation with fantasy points.
                        These metrics appear to be extremely poor indicators for how a wide receiver performs in fantasy and are not really predictable 
                        themselves.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                    This analysis is a continuation of the current sticky stat series I have been working on.
                    Generally speaking, the exploration of sticky stats is part of a larger effort to find reliable
                    predictors for fantasy football performance, at each position group.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The specific goal of this writing is to find receiving stats that are, positively, consistent from
                    year-to-year and also serve as useful indicators of fantasy performance.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The data used for the findings below is primarily from 2012-2022, unless otherwise stated.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Before diving in, I do recommend checking out some of the other pieces in the series:

            <h2 class="h2-blog">A Cursory Glance</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    As with the other data set explorations, we start with a general overview of the wide receiver data:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe style="width: 800px; height: 650px;" src="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/WR/stability/season/Basic-Receiving-Stat-Correlations.html"></iframe>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The heat map above is an encouraging start! While no one stat has a super strong correlation,
                    with itself or other stats, there is strong correlation across the board.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    This is a much better start, especially in comparision to the correlation heat map of
                    <a href="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/RB/stability-rushing/season/simple-rb.html">general running backs</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I want to point out that the trend of touchdowns being inconsistent, across the position groups, continues.
                    The correlation of <i>receiving_tds vs. receiving_tds_last</i> is 0.54, and it is by far the weakest self-correlated
                    year-to-year stat.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, if we take a look at a scatter plot for one of the strongest correlations above, <i>Receptions vs. Receptions Last</i>,
                    we can see that we have some noise:
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    To filter the data to find information on more fantasy relevant players, we will only
                    keep data points where players have played at least 10 games each of the current and previous
                    seasons.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    This filter yields the following heat map:

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    For the most part, receiving stats are still positively consistent across the board.
                    The only correlation that takes a serious hit is <i>receiving_tds vs. receiving_tds_last</i>,
                    which drops to 0.41. Touchdowns seem to be a fluky stat no matter the position in fantasy.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    A visual for how noisy the touchdown data is:

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    To get an even better sense of what the data currently looks with the applied filter,

                    Hovering over some points, our data quality has improved much more! We have far less noise and a 
                    higher concentration of fantasy relevant players.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Perhaps we can do better, in regards to finding fantasy relevant players. Let's add an additional filter of
                    being at least 2nd on the depth chart - in both seasons - as a wide receiver:

                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    While this stronger filter removes about 100 samples from the previous heat map, the correlations remain largely unchanged.
                    It seems that, outside of touchdowns, starting wide receivers tend to improve year-over-year.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The landscape for wide receivers is far more stable than the

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    In fact, it's even more stable compared to the

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    When performing this analysis, I have been trying to see if there's a difference between young and old
                    starters at the position. The idea being that at a certain point, there's a drop-off due to injuries,
                    father time catching up, or younger, better players taking over.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    For quarterbacks, <a href="/Fantasy/Blogs/sticky-stats/qbs-sticky-season-totals#diving-deeper-0">the age marker for the drop-off was around 30 years old</a>.
                    For backs, there wasn't a clear drop-off, at least when looking at stat correlations year-over-year. However, taking a look
                    at <a href="/Fantasy/Analysis/interactive/RB/stability-rushing/ypc-stability/ypc-v-age-10-games-10-samples-carries.html">yards per carry and total carries against fantasy points</a>,
                    shows a picture where backs severely decline by and after the age of 28.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The same doesn't really seem to apply for wide receivers. The biggest performance discrepancy I could by age was at 27.

                    Yes, there is a bit of a dip, but for the most part it's close.
                    Outside of touchdowns and fantasy points, these are still pretty solid correlations from year-to-year.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, the important question: which of these stats - that is positively predictable - is fantasy relevant? 
                    At the end of the day, it's great if a stat is predictable, but that does not really matter to us if there's
                    no use for it in predicting fantasy performance.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    So, in this section, we will check both the correlation of a stat to fantasy points and to its value in the previous year.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Before continuing, I want to note that the data set appears to have a couple of repeat stats. I believe these are small variations of the same stat. I'm looking
                    into the differences now, but await an answer from a creator of the data set.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now that's out of the way, we first start with stats from 2012-2022, these are slightly more basic than the next gen stats that we will also examine 
                    in this section. The strongest filter (played 10 games in back to back seasons and at least wide receiver two in both years)
                    yields the following bar graph, sorted by highest (left) to lowest (right) correlation to self:

                    All of these stats have at least decent-to-strong correlation with both themselves and fantasy points. The three in particular that
                    have above 0.70 correlation for both fantasy points and themselves year-to-year, are <i>wopr_y</i>, <i>ay_sh</i>, and <i>tgt_sh</i>,

                    Seems like wide receivers might be the most predictable position group. At the very least, this position group - for its fantasy 
                    relevant players - has the strongest correlation values for stats against fantasy points and against themselves year-over-year.

                    Before focusing in on the more useful stats, that could serve as indicators for wide receiver fantasy performance, I want to point out two stats
                    in the bar graph above: <i>avg_cushion_mean</i> and <i>avg_separation_mean</i>. Both appear to be at the very least noisy, but more likely 
                    irrelevant to fantasy performance.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    What does this mean? Well, chances are how much space a wide receiver gets before the snap and how much space a wide receiver has when the (in)completion
                    occurs, doesn't matter for fantasy. I found this to be quite interesting as it goes against intuition and what I have read. It's possible that these stats
                    don't matter for fantasy performance because wide receivers coming into the NFL are already good (enough) at breaking the press and getting separation.
                    I plan to dig deeper on this in a future write-up.

                    There is a little bit of change between the order of the columns of this focused bar graph and the previous focused one. I would attribute this mostly
                    to the time frame differences. This advanced stat bar graph is from 2016-2022, whereas the first focused bar graph on more "basic" stats used data from

                    I want to point out the <i>combined_metric</i>, which is the average of the non-fantasy points metrics. I strongly encourage you to

                    This very much touches on the idea of the trinity score, which is an aggregate metric composed of yards after catch (YAC), target share and air yards share.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I would argue that, based on the correlations above, YAC probably should not be used, if we are using a metric that only contains three stats.
                    To me, YAC probably should be replaced with weighted opportunity rating or receiving first down share. Likely the latter as the former might be too
                    repetitive with target share and air yards.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    That being said, why limit yourself to three stats when creating a predictive metric? This position has a a plethora of useful indicators, and more
                    information can be useful, especially when creating predictive models.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    That wraps up this one! As always, the recap: 
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Basic wide receiver stats correlate pretty strongly with themselves year-over-year, indicating that 
                        the wide receiver position is a positively predictable one.
                    </li>
                    <li>This more or less holds for starting wide receivers.</li>
                    <li>
                        Receiving touchdowns are the most fluky stat from the basic ones, but are more consistent year-over-year for starting wide receivers (0.40) than 
                        for starting quarterbacks (0.36) and starting running backs (0.25).
                    </li>
                    <li>Starting wide receivers have somewhat strong correlations on most of their basic stats (receptions, targets, receiving yards, etc.).</li>
                    <li>
                        There isn't as strong a drop-off for wide receivers, as for quarterbacks and running backs.
                        As long as a wide receiver is #1 or #2 on the depth chart, they are likely to produce in fantasy.
                        30 and on is when the number of wide receivers as the #1 or #2 becomes rare-to-extinct.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wide receivers have by far the strongest correlating stats, compared to running backs and quarterbacks.
                        This comparison is in regards to the stat against fantasy points and the stat against itself from year-to-year.
                        So, not only are wide receiver stats the most predictable here, but they also are good indicators of fantasy performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Three of the best metrics (I would argue the three best metrics) for wide receiver predictability are:
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('wopr_x')">weighted opportunity rating</a>,
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('ay_sh')">air yards share</a>, and
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('tgt_sh')">target share</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('cushion')">Cushion</a> and
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('separation')">separation</a> have extraordinarily poor correlation with fantasy points.
                        These metrics appear to be extremely poor indicators for how a wide receiver performs in fantasy and are not really predictable 
                        themselves.
                    </li>
