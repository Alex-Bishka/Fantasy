                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Allen, Hurts, Jackson and Fields were really the only quarterbacks who put up exciting rushing numbers last year.</li>
                    <li>Allen did this while also being by far and away the most efficient runner at QB.</li>
                    <li>Murray showcased some signs of life in the run game - his per game numbers are encouraging for next season, and I think 
                        he might be the next fifth QB who puts up exciting rushing numbers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Richardson is also in contention with Murray to be the next guy up, in terms of rushing production. Small sample size, 
                        but his 25 carries in about two and a half games of play is mouth-watering from a fantasy perspective. Health is the only 
                        question here.
                    </li>
                    <li>Purdy was the next most efficient rusher (per carry), of the QBs that are likely to start in 2024, after Allen. 
                        He might not put up elite rushing numbers, but he definitely has mobility.
                    </li>

            <h2 class="h2-blog">Overview</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Welcome back everyone! In this analysis piece, we'll finish our 2023 recap on quarterbacks by taking a look
                    at the rushing numbers. The rushing analysis should go pretty quickly, since there aren't many rushing quarterbacks
                    as of now. So, while the NFL is trending towards mobile quarterbacks, I don't think we can call this
                    <i>the age of the rushing quarterback</i>, yet.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    After breaking down the rushing numbers, we'll dive into a final recap, which will essentially be a soft ranking
                    and holistic evaluation of the quarterback position heading into the early stages of the offseason. This will 
                    draw upon numbers and points made in part <a href="/Blogs/2023-review/qbs.html">one</a> and 
                    <a href="/Blogs/2023-review/qbs-pt2.html">two</a> of the 2023 QB review series.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Also, as a reminder, the data used excludes any QB that played less than five games. This serves as a proxy to 
                    reduce fluctuations from injury. I want to point out that this means my Richardson comments are just by hand comparison
                    - he is not actually in the numbers analyzed below.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    With that out of the way, let's dive in!
                </p>
            </div>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">Basic Rushing Stats</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    We'll start simple with a slider on rushing yards covering season totals, per game, and per carry numbers:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container slider" id="slider1">
                    <iframe class="slider-iframe" src="/Analysis/interactive-2.0/QB/2023-review-pt3/scatter_rushing_yards.html"></iframe>

                    <div>
                        <button class="graph-slider-prev" onclick="changeIframeSrc('slider1', -1)">&#10094;</button>
                        <button class="graph-slider-next" onclick="changeIframeSrc('slider1', 1)">&#10095;</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The top four QBs on the season numbers are the guys that would come to mind for rushing production: Jackson, Fields, Hurts,
                    and Allen. They have a pretty big gap over the rest of the pack, with Josh Allen's 524 yards on the season being over 100
                    yards more than Dobbs' 421. This is a large reason why I put Allen in his own QB tier in dynasty. His production in the air
                    can rival the best of them, but seemingly none of the elite fantasy passers can compete with his rushing production.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    From a season total perspective, it is nice to see TLaw, Young and Love all as QB1s. Some positives to take for the rough season
                    the former two had, and more to build on for Love. Moreover, Mahomes getting some work on the ground is good to see from a fantasy
                    perspective. The 389 rushing yards is a career high for Mahomes. He can get it done on the ground, with how he manipulates defenses,
                    so it would be nice to see him utilize his legs a bit more, from a fantasy perspective. I wouldn't bet on that, especially if KC
                    addresses their wide receiver core this offseason.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    If we slide over to the per game numbers, it's clear that there are two running backs in disguise playing quarterback: Jackson and 
                    Fields. These guys can really run the ball (the sky is blue!), which provides them with a solid fantasy floor and a high ceiling.
                    However, you have to wonder how much longer Fields will keep a starting job, given the little interest Chicago has had for him this
                    offseason, and the fact that we seem to be nearing an explicit "Bears will draft Caleb" message.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Outside of those two, it is nice to see Danny dimes as QB4 on this list. You have to wonder what he could do if he had an oline.
                    I don't think he'd like up the world, but I can see him as a serviceable QB2 if the Giants could keep him upright and healthy.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Furthermore, it's good to see Kyler at QB7 for rushing yards per game. By the numbers, it seems like he's returning to Kyler pre-injury,
                    which was a guy who put up elite fantasy production. I still find him to be decent value for his current KTC ranking of QB11, but the
                    buy-low window on him is definitely slammed shut at this point.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Lastly, and more for fun, let's slide over to the yards per carry numbers. I find this to be a little encouraging for Bryce Young.
                    His passing might not have been exciting last year, but there might be a QB2 there boosted by production from his legs. Going back 
                    to Kyler, it is encouraging to see him next to Lamar in the yards per carry numbers. I want to note that there probably isn't too 
                    much weight to this stat: Allen is firmly in QB2 range and Hurts isn't even on this list (push tush is not efficient!).
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Moving onto the season total and per game carry numbers:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container slider" id="slider3">
                    <iframe class="slider-iframe" src="/Analysis/interactive-2.0/QB/2023-review-pt3/scatter_carries.html"></iframe>

                    <div>
                        <button class="graph-slider-prev" onclick="changeIframeSrc('slider3', -1)">&#10094;</button>
                        <button class="graph-slider-next" onclick="changeIframeSrc('slider3', 1)">&#10095;</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Again, it adds up that our top four quarterbacks, by total carries on the season are: Hurts, Jackson, Fields and Allen.
                    At this point, it should be pretty expected that these guys will top 100 carries in a season, which gives them such strong
                    floors and high ceilings in any game. I think the hope is that Richardson will join this group - likely replacing Fields - 
                    and be a 100-plus carry a season guy. He had 25 carries in about two and a half total games this season, so the only question 
                    for him is health, especially since his passing appears to be acceptable at a minimum - I know, small sample size.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    It is interesting to see Mahomes so high up with 75 carries this season - this is another career high for him, so probably
                    an outlier than a sign of things to come. Also, good to see TLaw with 70 carries. At this point, it seems like 65-70 carries
                    and 300 or so yards will be a consistent stat line in his career. Hopefully, he can figure out how to protect the ball better
                    and improve his consistency as a passer.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Sliding over, not too much changes on a per game basis. We do see Danny Dimes and Kyler Murray sneak up into the QB1 range,
                    which is encouraging for both, but overall the picture remains largely the same on a per game basis.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Rounding out with season total and per game rushing touchdown numbers:
                </p>
                <div class="iframe-container slider" id="slider2">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Being a big QB or having brotherly love leads to a lot of touchdowns. Who would've guessed?
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Sarcasm aside, I find it a little hard to Allen to repeat his 15 rushing touchdowns next year, considering that was the first
                    time he broke 10 in a year. I will double down on this if the Bills bring in a veteran back for goal line work. So, I would
                    expect a little regression here - maybe to 10 or so.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The 15 for Hurts was also a season high, but he had 13 in 2022 and 10 in 2021, so I'd expect him to hover a bit higher than Allen.
                    Although, if Kelce retires, the "tush push" might end up being less effective next year, and maybe that will cause a further dip
                    for Hurts' rushing touchdown production next year. Something to think about.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Outside of these two, touchdowns don't come often for the other quarterbacks in the league on the ground. This is where I could 
                    see Anthony Richardson really establishing himself in fantasy. His size and athleticism, paired with the creativity of that 
                    offense could very easily lead to 10 or so rushing touchdowns next year, again provided he stays healthy.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    From a per game perspective, I want to point out that Kyler is number 3 (of the fantasy QBs/starters that we are considering 
                    relevant to this conversation) in touchdowns per game, with a little over 1 every three games. It's still far from Allen and Hurts,
                    but if the Cardinals add some more talent around him, I think 5-7 touchdowns on the ground is a pretty safe and reasonable
                    expectation from him. If he returns to his inspired 2020 form, then 10 might be reachable.
                </p>

                        Switching over to clustering, we will go ahead and tier quarterbacks based on the following season total stats:

                        <li><b>Cluster 1 (Purple):</b> Hurts and Allen: rushing touchdown machines. They back this by also being top four in carries and rushing yards, amongst QBs.</li>

                    <ul class='bullet-list'>
                        <li><b>Cluster 0 (Dark Blue):</b> It's nice to see some of the more traditional pass first guys use their legs for more than just buying time in the pocket, specifically Mahomes and TLaw, but it's unlikely any of these guys will turn in great rushing production seasons. The exception here, due to injury, is Murray.</li>
                        <li><b>Cluster 1 (Purple):</b> Again, maybe some touchdown regression is due for these two? They should still have around 550-600 rushing yards next season, but it will be tough to match 15 rushing touchdowns.</li>
                        <li><b>Cluster 2 (Red):</b> This cluster can largely be ignored.</li>
                        <li><b>Cluster 3 (Green):</b> The only improvement these two need to make on the ground game is getting into the endzone. I do find this to be unlikely as Jackson has a career high of 7 rushing touchdowns in a season, whereas Fields has 8 and he might not be in a starting job much longer. Fantastic production otherwise. </li>

                    What's interesting to me here is how much Josh Allen separates himself form the rest of the pack. His 54.38 rushing epa for the
                    season is almost 30 more than second place Fields with 25.81. What does this mean? Well, Allen's rushing ability generates 
                    a lot of value for his team. More specifically than just value, his rushing contributes significantly to the scoreboard for the
                    Bills. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now you might be thinking, so what? Hurts also scored 15 touchdowns. While that's true, Hurts has a measly 21.28 rushing epa
                    on the season, which means his rushing was not even half as valuable to the scoreline as Allen's. When you pair this with the fact
                    that <a href="/Blogs/2023-review/qbs-pt2.html#advanced-passing-stats-0">Allen was also top four for passing epa</a>,
                    it really highlights how valuable he is to the Bills and how much of an impact he has on the score of a game.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The latter portion of that is critical to fantasy, as total epa has a
                    <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToParagraph('total-epa-and-fantasy-points-correlation-0', 10)">decent-to-strong correlation with fantasy points</a>.
                    So, if we know which players are likely to have a high epa, we have a pretty good indicator that their fantasy production
                    will also be high. The only problem here is that epa is a difficult stat to predict from season to season, but that's a different
                    discussion.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I feel like I have to keep apologizing with how much I focus on Allen in these reviews, but he's production is absolutely insane!
                    It also feels difficult to get across just how good he is, and it's not just in passing or rushing, but in both areas of fantasy
                    production! There's no one else like him right now, this is what you hope QBs with rushing upside end up like.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Sliding over to the per game variation, the numbers Bryce Young and Howell display here are redeeming. They are both awkward fantasy
                    assets to hold right now, but I think this rushing analysis has shown they can put up some decent rushing production. It is more a 
                    matter of can their passing improve to stay in the NFL long term? Admittedly, this applies a little more to Howell than Young currently.

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Moreover, it is interesting to see Lamar so low on this list. I'd like to attribute that to his lack of touchdowns, but it might be possible
                    that his runs haven't contributed to the Ravens' scoreline (much) more than the average expectation. Curious. The same observation applies 
                    to his rushing epa per carry numbers, where he is in tier 3...

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, the per carry numbers are mostly for fun, like above, but I want to point out that Purdy is number two amongst QBs that we know are starters
                    next year, behind Allen. He doesn't run a lot, but he has legitimate mobility, and when he does take off it is usually effective.

            <h2 class="h2-blog">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    That will wrap up my analysis on quarterback rushing production and general production in 2023. Before ending this
                    piece I want to leave off with a few final thoughts reflecting my overall findings:
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Josh Allen is the only quarterback who can put up elite passing and rushing numbers. For that reason, he is my fantasy QB1,
                        in his own tier.
                    </li>
                    <li>Even though Mahomes had a rough fantasy season, he was still highly effective at passing the ball. He also put up his best 
                        rushing production season ever. I expect his QB8 finish to be an outlier, and not the norm going forward, especially if KC
                        address their wide receiver woes this offseason.
                    </li>
                    <li>There's a lot of young QB talent in the league right now that should excite the fantasy community: Stroud, Love, and Purdy
                        all finished as QB1s on the season. There are pretty big price discrepancies between these young bucks, which likely means
                        there is a good opportunity to land a trade that will be lopsided in a few years.
                    </li>
                    <li>Prescott and Lamar had excellent 2023 seasons. That being said, they are my sell high candidates, as the Cowboys had 
                        an easier 2023 schedule, and Lamar has yet to show us year-to-year consistency, even if that is largely attributed to 
                        injuries (to him or the team around him).
                    </li>
                    <li>Herbert and Burrow are my buy lows due to their injury riddled 2023. Burrow might fit better here as coach and draft
                        hype (a la Nabers to the Chargers) could pop the bubble on Herbert's buy low window. Kyler Murray is a name worth mentioning
                        here, but I do believe his true buy low window was about 6-12 months ago.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fields is still an outlier in the passing game, and not in a good way. It seems like he'll have at least one more season
                        as a starter somewhere in the league, but he may not be a starter for long if his passing does not improve. As long as 
                        Fields plays he is fantasy relevant due to his rushing capabilities. That being said, I do not like Fields long term, as
                        I don't think he will progress enough as a passer to keep an NFL job.
                    </li>
                    <li>Purdy had a ridiculously efficient 2023 season. That season lands him in the same tier as some amazing quarterbacks in the past 
                        15 years or so. The worst of the bunch, at least for fantasy purposes, is probably Philip Rivers. Make of that what you will,
                        but as long as he is tied to the 49ers and Shanahan, I struggle to see him finish lower than QB10.
                    </li>
                    <li>I like Richardson's upside. I think he's already shown more than Fields in the passing game, and his athleticism is off the 
                        charts. Pair that with Shane Steichen, and that sounds like a recipe for success to me.
                    </li>
                    <li>I'm struggling to see TLaw and Tua as solid QB1s going forward. The former appears too inconsistent and needs to protect 
                        the football more. The latter has no rushing production and doesn't put up enough passing touchdowns to compensate. I'm 
                        willing to give both another year to see if they can turn my opinion on this.
                    </li>
                    <li>There's quite a few vet quarterbacks who look to be good bang for your buck at the QB position next year. Kirk and Stafford
                        should both be serviceable starters (the latter more so in super flex formats). Wilson might also be in this conversation -
                        practically free and likely to be a starter somewhere. Mayfield, and Goff are other names that might have a "vet 
                        discount" (i.e. under-priced due to age).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <p class='blog-p-tag'>
                        Depending on what data range you use the correlation value of total epa to fantasy points, in the same season, varies a little
                        bit. However, when looking at the quarterback data from 2012-2022 (inclusive), there is a correlation of 0.724 between the two
                        stats. So, if could predict future total epa accurately, we should be able to have a good idea of what future fantasy production
                        looks like, at least for quarterbacks.
