                    Hello, fantasy enthusiasts! Welcome to our deep dive into the world of wide receivers in 2023!
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    In this installment, we'll peel back the layers on how wideouts have fared this past season, employing a mix of basic stats
                    like receptions and yards, alongside more nuanced figures such as target share and dominator. Moreover, we shall utilize these
                    stats to create cluster plots, placing wide receivers into tiers based on their production during 2023. This provides us with
                    even more insight about how players fare against each other.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    The aim, as usual, is to sift through the noise and spotlight surprising information, which ideally allows us to make more informed
                    decisions on wide receivers (i.e. if a player is undervalued, overvalued, great value, etc.).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Overall, this review will closely mimic the quarterback series. So, buckle up as we navigate the highs and lows, the expected and
                    the surprises of the wide receiver landscape, all while gearing up for what these insights might mean for your next fantasy season!

                    It's always great to begin with first principles: fantasy points. It's good to refresh ourselves with what numbers players put up.

                    There's quite a few wide receiver names that deserve praise here, and with so many impressive seasons, you'll have to excuse me
                    if I don't specifically name someone.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Three names to me particularly standout: CD Lamb, Amon-Ra, and Puka. They finshed as WR1, WR3, and WR4 on the season, respectively.
                    Additionally, their per game numbers were equally impressive as WR1, WR4 and WR6, respectively.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    What do I take away from this?
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Well, CD's season puts him in, or damn near close the Jefferson and Chase tier for my money. They're all the same age, and CD just
                    showed he can have a truly elite season. I think some may argue that Chase might be the worst of these three, at least based on
                    season stats, but I would blame injuries to him and Burrow for decreased production. Even with the injuries, Chase still has the
                    highest ceiling in any one game out of these three receivers. I think Tyreek might be the closest to his explosive fantasy scoring
                    ability, but being 30 years old keeps him a bit further away from the value of these three studs.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Moving onto Amon-Ra, I would place him below CD, Jefferson, and Chase. He's in the same tier as AJ Brown for me (to round out the 
                    current top five wide receivers in dynasty), but I would rather have Amon-Ra. The man delivers 100 yard games very consistently - 
                    he only had four games under 90 yards last year. Additionally,
                    his <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38743246/lions-wr-amon-ra-st-brown-driven-great">work ethic seems to be
                        about as good as it gets</a>. Pair that with his young age, and being in a high powered offense, the Sun God is easily WR4
                    for me right now. The one thing missing from his fantasy game are explosive games. He hasn't shown a high ceiling as often as the 
                    three above him, but his floor is about as good as it gets.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Now, after those five guys, the position rankings become really murky for me. Puka's rookie season was
                    <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/rams-wr-puka-nacua-sets-new-rookie-record-for-receiving-yards-receptions">historic</a>
                    and it does put him in the discussion for next best receiver. Furthermore, he did finish above AJ Brown in both points per game and 
                    season total points. I'm just not ready to put him above Brown, or in the same tier as Puka had a lenghty injury history in
                    college (this is why he fell from being a 2nd or 3rd round pick to the 5th) and I feel Brown's quarterback situation is better.
                    So, I have to put Puka in that next tier with players like Wilson, Hill (only here because he's 30), and Olave. Note, I think there's 
                    a lot of room for debate here with guys like Aiyuk, Waddle, Smith, etc.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Some more points I want to dive into, but we still have a long way to go on this analysis, so bullets to try and be concise:
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Evans and Allen are ageless vets. Evans finished as WR7 on the season and WR10 on a points per game basis. Allen 
                        was WR3 on a points per game basis. I would look to acquire them as a contending team.
                    </li>
                    <li>Amari Cooper would be the budget version of the two vets above, finishing as WR18 on a per game basis.</li>
                    <li>Diggs also deserves a consideration as a contender vet purchase, but his disappearance at the end of the season would make
                        me a bit more nervous.</li>
                    <li>Hill is the premium vet to acquire.</li>
                    <li>The Texans wide receiver duo looks legit. Dell and Collins both finished as top ten wide receivers on a per game basis.</li>
                    <li>Olave produced more than Smith and Waddle on a per game basis. Carr is probably the only thing holding him back.</li>
                    <li>Wilson did regress, but he had even worse quarterback play this year. 1000-plus yards in back-to-back season with the 
                        QBs he's had is impressive.
                    </li>
                    <li>I'd argue the season Pickens had is also quite impressive for the same reason. He finished just behind Wilson in total points, 
                        despite having worse (hard to say if I'm honest, both had horrible QBs) quarterback play.
                    </li>
                    <li>Higgins and Ridley were both WR3s on a per game basis this season. Not ideal. Maybe another year of football helps Ridley.
                        Higgins needs to stay healthy, along with Burrow.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    That about does it for the fantasy points observations, again a lot to cover, so I'm sure I missed something somewhere. At the end 
                    of the day, there are a lot of wide receivers to like, and it feels hard to know who's going to round out the WR1 category outside
                    of the 5-6 high end studs, especially with another (theoretically) loaded wide receiver class coming in. I think if you're high on 
                    anyone who finished in that WR2-3 range who is young and has talent (i.e. Olave, Flowers, Reed, etc.), I'd make an offer before
                    their price explodes.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I think this influx of talent also makes the older, but reliable guys drop to affordable prices. Pittman and 
                    Metcalf are two examples of this to me. Really solid pieces on just about any fantasy team.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    Next, we check out fantasy points per reception and per target:

                    I thought these plots might lead to some interesting insights, but that doesn't appear to be the case. They appear to favor deep
                    threat or explosive play wide receivers, which aren't really the same as elite (fantasy) wide receivers.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-p-tag">
                    I will say it is impressive to see Deebo in the top 12 on both of these plots. Also, maybe Shakir being 10th in points per target
                    might be a good selling point if you're trying to move him - even if it doesn't really mean anything. In the words of Homer Simpson,
                    "Oh, people can come up with statistics to prove anything Kent".
