                We will be focusing on trying to create tiers of backs - via clustering - based on
                their all around game.

                In future articles, we may revisit the quarterback and wide receiver positions to try and gain insights
                via clustering and tiers.

                <li>I don't take into account anything related to two point conversions, partly due to
                    the randomness and small sample size but mostly because it was difficult to incorporate into the

                    fetched</li>
                <li>The top 40 RBs I analyze are by the top 40 fantasy point totals, this is done for

                The quick breakdown of each tier:
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li><b>Cluster 0:</b> These backs don't get the most yards, or touchdowns. They do get good work in the receiving game.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 1:</b> These backs produce overall, but are pretty poor in the receiving department.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 2:</b> The best of the bunch, pretty good-to-elite at everything.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Backs that concern me from being in Cluster 0: Mixon and White.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Mixon looked like he was struggling last year, and
                his season totals reflect that quite a bit. I'm not sure how much longer he has as the Bengals RB1.
                I would be looking to move off of him for a young gun with potential or upgrade to a Kamara.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                White has shown up in some games this year, but I don't believe in him sticking around long. His issues seem
                similar to Najee's for me: they just are a little slow, and you can't help but feel a more explosive back would
                be better than either of them in their current situations. It does seem like White will end the year as a budget
                Big Lenny from 2022, but I don't have much confidence in him being a cornerstone to a fantasy franchise.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Outside of that, it is a bit hard to glean too much from Clusters 1 and 2, since there's a decent amount of overlap between the clusters.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                However, a noteworthy observation is that Najee is in Cluster 2 over guys like K9, Miles Sanders, and Pollard.
                Before going off the Najee hype express, he is either towards the bottom or barely middle of this pack in each of the categories
                we are using to construct these tiers.

                I am a bigger fan of K9 because of his home run ability. Also, K9's numbers are a little skewed last year, as he didn't play much weeks
                1-4 last year, and missed week 13. As a result, I'm willing to give him more of a pass than Pollard.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Pollard to me was a trap for this year. In redraft, he was going around round 2, which feels like his ceiling to me. I'm
                skeptical that he can have a better year than last, which was buoyed by 12 touchdowns. Of the backs to get 12 or more touchdowns,
                only Elliot and Jamaal Williams had less total yardage, and while Pollard's total yardage - 1378 - is not bad, it is lower
                than every other back in Cluster 2, except Najee.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                This means there were 11 backs with more total yards than him. Additionally, there's a handful of backs in his neighborhood.
                As a result, he has strong competition to finish higher in fantasy than last season. For that reason, I felt he was being
                drafted and valued at his ceiling. I think Pollard is a great player and a solid fantasy asset, but I 
                hated his price before the season (he was RB10 to RB5 on KTC from Aug. 16 to Sept. 26).
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Pollard might make an intersting buy low at the end of the season, if he finishes as an RB2/fringe RB1.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The other big point to talk about is Najee in Cluster 3. There are some really good fantasy seasons in that Cluster, so it is a little
                surprising seeing him there at first, but Najee finished strong last season to end on 1263 yards and 10 touchdowns.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                That's not a bad season by any means, but you probably wouldn't expect Najee's name to be paired with the rest of those backs.
                He is an outlier in that group, but the fumble, touchdown and carry numbers just squeeze him into it.

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Clusters 1 and 2 are the middle of the pack backs, largely separate due to fumbling. Cluster 1 fumbles a lot less than Cluster 2. Otherwise,
                Cluster 2 is only worse at scoring and efficiency numbers.

                For those suffering Najee owners, at least 2022 was a good year. Maybe if the Steelers figure it out, he can become a more viable option?
                I doubt that would help that much, as Najee simply looks slow when I watch him.

                A quick rundown of the clusters:
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li><b>Cluster 0:</b> Touchdown hogs with a decent number of carries. Pretty mediocre at everything else.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 1:</b> Backs with a solid all around game, but don't score as much as you would like.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 2:</b> Reliable touchdown and yardage numbers is an understatement. You wish their receptions and targets could be just as dependable. Decent efficiency numbers.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 3:</b> Probably the most efficient cluster of backs. Middling for yardage and scoring, and even worse with receptions and targets. Low-to-middle of the pack for carries as well.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 4:</b> Running back royalty: CMC and Ekeler.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 5:</b> Bad at just about everything. These backs redeem themselves slightly with their receptions and targets.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Our bottom tier, represented by Cluster 5 here, remains unchanged.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                We still have passing royalty in Cluster 4 and rushing royalty in Cluster 2. Cluster 2 has shrunk to basically the backs who had 
                elite rushing numbers last year, plus Dalvin Cook. I say "plus Cook" as he is towards the bottom of this group in touchdowns scored
                and total rushing yards. Cook's receptions and targets just get him into this tier.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 0 is something worth pointing out, as there usually are a couple of backs who end up being redzone monsters.
                Elliot and Williams held that role last year, but having an idea of who might spring into that role in upcoming seasons
                would be very valuable, as these types of backs can be bought for cheap and lead a championship charge for you.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Our remaining two clusters have quality backs in them, but I am slightly more partial to Cluster 1 as they seem to get more volume
                (both in the passing and running game) and accumulate more yardage.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                It should be noted that I am staunchly of the philosophy that yardage is most import stat to a player, as I believe it to be far more
                replicable than touchdown numbers. Perhaps I will be adding an analysis piece on this in the near future.

                    <li><b>Cluster 0:</b> Backs whose numbers are on the lower end. They do get a decent amount of carries, on okay-to-good efficiency.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 1:</b> Elite yardage and scoring numbers, on decent running efficiency. Middle of the pack for targets and receptions. The rushing version of the CMC/Ekeler tier.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 2:</b> Meh-to-poor yardage numbers, with middle of the pack touchdown numbers. On the heavier side of targets and receptions. Not many carries, and all over the place with the rushing efficiency. Don't really fumble.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 3:</b> Bad at everything except targets and receptions, where they are middle of the pack. Fumble numbers are okay.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 4:</b> PPR Kings CMC and Ekeler.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 5:</b> Backs that are good at everything except scoring. They also tend to fumble a bit more than the other clusters.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 6:</b> Great touchdown numbers on okay yardage. Less than ideal in the receiving game. Decent amount of carries, on varying efficiency.</li>

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Our worst tier has finally been split in two: Cluster 2 and Cluster 3.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 2 is actually fantasy relevant. All of these backs were saved by their receiving work.
                Note, Swift and Mixon are here. I am more optimistic on Swift, because he has improved his situation a lot more
                and Mixon's problems seem realted to age. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 3 is abysmal. These backs might serve as a spot start here and there, but should generally be out of your lineup.
                White might be the exception to the rule, as his 2023 season portrays him as Big Lenny lite, which is to say solid.
                Again, I do have concerns with White. He reminds me of Najee a lot when I see him: a plodder.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Clusters 1 and 4 are the refined, regal ones for rushing and receiving, respectively. Outside of Chubb (RIP), I would be happy with
                any of these backs on a contending roster.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 0 is full of RB3s. Outside of Conner - who is significantly better on a per game basis - and Taylor 
                - as a potential buy low - I did not want to touch any of the backs in this tier.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                However, with how things have gone this year, Mostert is worth paying for as a contender. I would not break the bank for
                him due to age and injury concerns, but his 12 touchdowns this year is insane!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Clusters 5 and 6 consists of player seasons that fringe RB1s, or solidly RB2. These are the types of guys who I look at
                for trying to find good value, especially if the situation improves, or if someone who is better takes over their situation
                (see Monty and Swift replacing Williams and Sanders).
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I would say that K9 in Cluster 6 might represent an opportunity to buy low on him, especially since his last few games have
                been a bit undesirable. K9 also has a tough remaining schedule, so there might be a better chance to buy him. There is a little
                risk with buying K9 with Charbonnet in that backfield, but his home run ability is soooo special. I see K9 as, at worst, a perennial
                RB2.
            </p>

                    <li><b>Cluster 0:</b> Generally poor at yardage per game and touchdowns per game. Decent numbers in regards to receptions and targets per game. Poor rushing efficiency.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 1:</b> Solid yardage and touchdown per game numbers. Stuggle in the passing game. Pretty good efficiency numbers.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 2:</b> The backs who get the most yards, receptions and targets. Okay efficiency on a lot of carries. The fumblers of the group.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                You want your back to be in Cluster 2 year after year. These backs will be, at worst, RB2 guys on a per game basis.
                You should note that Dameon Pierce is in this tier. This is why I am higher than him on Raschaad White. Pierce's per game
                numbers reflect very favorably on him.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                White could still end up being a budget 2022 Big Lenny, but, again, I'm not sold on him. I don't think either back is 
                supremely talented, but I like the tape more from Pierce, and his numbers from 2022 definitely cause me to favor him
                over White. Once again, a risky and intriguing buy low.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I would also like to highlight Taylor, Conner, and Kamara are all in Cluster 2. Some of my favorite buys in dynasty formats.

                A quick breakdown on each tier:
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li><b>Cluster 0:</b> Backs with solid yard per game numbers and even better touchdown per game numbers. They pull a great disappearing act in the receiving game, but are decently efficient running the ball on a middling amount of carries.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 1:</b> High total yardage, with middling touchdown numbers. Good presence in the passing game. High carries on okay-to-great efficiency. Fumble a lot.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 2:</b> The elite backs. Great at pretty much each facet of the game.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 3:</b> See Cluster 0 in the previous graph: "Generally poor at yardage per game and touchdowns per game. Decent numbers in regards to receptions and targets per game. Poor rushing efficiency."</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Mixon being in Cluster 2 really catches my eye here. Up until this point, I would say the numbers have not represented him super favorably.
                He is towards the bottom of this cluster in yards and touchdowns per game. Mixon's receptions and targets keep him in this group.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                I would use this as a selling point in negotiations, as Mixon seems to be coming close to the end of line, especially since he 
                is on track for a second straight season of worsening numbers.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 1 contains really solid backs. Outside of Cook, all of these guys should provide some level of serviability for the rest of this season.
                It also appears to be a plug for ETN, as I see this tier as just below the cluster of exellence: Cluster 2, which is largely due to touchdown numbers.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Najee also looks favorable here, but he seems to have gotten worse this year.
                Part of that might be the overall situation in Pittsburgh, but either way, I would be surprised if he finds himself
                in this quality of tier by the end of the 2023 season.

                Again, I am shocked to see Mixon in such a great tier.
                Perhaps he can offer contenders more than I thought, but I do feel concerned about his future.
                Although, outside of carries per game and fumbles, he is worse than CMC and Ekeler at everything else. 
                Still, some good news in what is a mixed bag of a fantasy asset.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Outside of that, it is good to see some of the undervalued (at least at the start of the season) backs in Cluster 4:
                Jones, Kamara, ETN, Conner, Swift, and Taylor.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                There still are some really good buys in that group, even if they aren't "low".
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The other noteworthy observation that popped out to me was Pollard in Cluster 1. This cluster has the big four in terms of rushing:
                Jacobs, Henry, Barkley, and Chubb.
                Pollard seems a little out of place here, but outside of his yards per game
                (the only back in this cluster with less than 100 yards per game), he is pretty firmly in that tier.

                We having the PPR studs in Cluster 4. In Cluster 1, we have the pinnacle of PPR back performance: Ekeler.
                He was a bit better than CMC last year, but I think it's his league leading 1.05 touchdowns a game that
                separates him from CMC and anyone else in Cluster 4. I think this shows us that Ekeler might be a tad more
                valuable as a back than CMC for 2023 - but CMC is killing it right now, whereas Ekeler is on the up from
                some injuries.

                Cluster 3 is the very poor man's version of Cluster 4. Perhaps White can jump out of this tier in 2023 and replace
                Big Lenny in Cluster 4? Or be a slightly worse version of Big Lenny? To be determined...

                It's good to see K9 in that tier with Chubb. I do think him and Charbonnet could mimic the golden days of Hunt and Chubb,
                but that would be in an ideal world.

                Great names to buy (low) in Cluster 1: Jones (low), Kamara, ETN, Conner (low), Pierce (low), and Taylor (low).

            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Lastly, it is disappointing to see Swift stuck in Cluster 2. I suppose those that bought were expecting Cluster 0 performance
                this year, based on Swift replacing Sanders. So far, I would be excited with the results.

                You could say the same for Monty replacing Williams - injuries aside.

                A quick rundown of each cluster:
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li><b>Cluster 0:</b> Mixon and Big Lenny: average yards and tds per game, but a strong presence in the passing game.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 1:</b> Jacobs and Henery: yardage monsters who can get into the endzone reliably. Some presence in the passing game, but their forte is on the ground.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 2:</b> Another strong rushing group of backs. Less prolific yardage numbers, but stronger scoring numbers than Cluseter 1. Slightly less presence in the passing game than Cluster 1, but a bit more efficient and safer with the ball.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 3:</b> Good all around backs who just need to get into the endzone a bit more to be monsters. A bit of a fumbling problem.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 4:</b> Ekeler and CMC: the Gods of PPR.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 5:</b> Pretty poor, as group, at everything exception receptions and targets per game.</li>
                    <li><b>Cluster 6:</b> A slightly worse version of Cluster 2.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The picture largely stays the same, but we see that Mixon and Big Lenny are a budget version of Ekeler and CMC.
                Still produce good value last year.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                We are also shown the distinction between an elite, optimizied rushing back in Cluster 1 and those who are close, but not quite
                there in Cluster 2 (a bit harsh on Chubb in my option). Again, great to see K9 in that cluster with Chubb.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Our poor man's Mixon and Big Lenny tier, remains with Cluster 5. The numbers continue to hate on White, eh?
                In his defense, his role was behind Big Lenny, so take it with some salt.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Cluster 3 is the sweet spot for some good buys for contenders looking to get affordable vets (Kamara, Conner, etc.)
                and those looking to grab cornerstones to finish a rebuild (ETN and Taylor).
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                The last cluster to mention is six. We've already covered Swift, but two big surprises have come from that cluster this year: Pacheco and Mostert.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Mostert has looked electric in that Miami offense, and his touchdown numbers are absolutely wild this year (12 total already).
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Pacheco on the other hand, seems to have stolen a lot of McKinnon's role, which is super exciting as his big weakness last
                year was his lack of involvement in the passing game. He was a fringe RB3 last year, despite a very slow start (he barely played weeks 1-7).
                Throw in the extra games and a good amount of McKinnon's receiving production and you have a strong candidate for an RB1.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Pacheco might very well be the budget version of ETN. An interesting buy for both contenders and rebuilders who are close to 
                being relevant.
            </p>


            <h2 class="h2-blog">Summary</h2>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                That brings this analysis to an end. I hope that you all have gained something from this, it opened my eyes on a couple
                of players, when looking at their performance, wholistically, from last year.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                Without further ado, the recap:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Contender buy considerations: CMC, Ekeler, Kamara, Conner, Swift, Monty, Mostert and Jones.</li>
                <li>Cornerstone buy considerations: Taylor, ETN, K9, and Pacheco(?).</li>
                <li>Players to consider dumping: Mixon, White, and Pollard.</li>
                <li>Buy low considerations: Pierce, Taylor, Conner, and Jones.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-p-tag">
                As a heads up, the next few blog posts will wrap up the analysis on 2022 performances.
                From there, I'll be flexible with the topic, but expect something more relevant to player 
                or position performances in 2023.
