# TODO List

## Data Enhancement

Improve data set:
-[] Link players to each other? The idea is to have quality of players with each other
-[] Context to team mate strength? Perhaps league rankings, or other metrics showing not only the offense's quality, but also the quality of individual players
-[] Context to defensive strength/strenght of schedule

WR data to construct/grab:
-[] accurate number for routes? currently employing a (strong) proxy based on snap counts and team play selection
-[] 3rd down conversions
-[x] depth chart
-[] contested catch rate - maybe not since this is part of the limited FTN data (since 2022...)
-[] garbage time contributions?

## Player comp tool

-[] compare any historical year to any other historical year
-[] clustering tool - historically

## Questions

- Do we need to weigh certain stats differently? In WR context, maybe getting 1400 yards is much much harder than 1000 yards, or the idea of going from 1000 -> 1400 is much harder than 600 -> 1000...
