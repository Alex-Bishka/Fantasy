# QB Analysis

## The Top 3

The top 3 guys are really worth their value. Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes are all phenominal for their value - each almost posting a full 5 points greater than the QB5. Any of these guys would offer an elite positional advantage.

Hurts actually had the most PPG last year with 25.2. He's projected as QB 3 in redraft, and that seems an absolute steal to me, especially since his schedule will probably force him to play more this year (although it could be said that tougher opposition might lead to less points). He's tremendous value at the end of round 2 or anywhere in 3.

## Joe Cool

Burrow was the QB4 in PPG and total points last year. He is closer to the top 3 (from a total points perspective) than the rest of the bunch. He's pretty much in the middle b/w QB5 and QB3 for PPG. He's currently QB 5 in redraft and that seems like good value to me, especially since he offers a good positional advantage, and he could be even better with a fully healthy Chase. Although he had a calf strain in preseason, so tbd if that affects him at all.

## The Running Backs

Lamar and Fields are practically tied in PPG and were QB 6 and QB 5 in PPG, respectively, last season. Both could have even bigger years this year as the Ravens drafted Flowers and are finally healthy, whereas the Bears added a lot of quality around Fields this upcoming year. Both could be in discussion for breaking up the top 3 this year. Both do have insane ceilings and depressing floors, although the latter applies more to Fields than Lamar.

## The Rest

An interesting note is that Kyler was QB 7 last year in PPG and is best of the rest. He could be great value in a dynasty league - currently QB 15 on KTC rankings - but his injury progression and contract are something to keep an eye on.

Herbert was outside the top 12 QBs in PPG, but he was banged up along with the rest of the offense. He has to be a candidate for one of the biggest risers in these rankings.

It'll be interesting to see how Danny Dimes and Mr. Keep the Receipts play this year. Both were QB 1 value last year in total points and PPG, and might be sneaky value adds in both redraft and dynasty.

TLaw, Tua, and Dak all had moments last year and could be very interesting candidates for rebounds/further progression. To me, TLaw is the most exciting due to his finish to last season and the addition of Ridley.

## Other Observations and Takeaways:

**QB One Observations:**
 - QB 1s play a min of 15 games
 - Other than Fields, all other qbs completed at least 300 passes (fields had 196)
 - Most QBs attempted at least 500 passes, exceptions: Hurts 460, Fields 318, and Jones 472 
 - Passing yard number seems to be 4000, exceptions: Hurts 3701, Fields 2242, Jones 3205
 - Magic number for passing tds is 25, exceptions: Hurts, Fields, Jones
 - Sub 15 interceptions
 - Allen, Hurts, Fields, and Jones all had over 120 ruhsing attempts (the only QB 1s above 100 rushing attempts), Fields and Hurts had over 160
 - Each of the above had over 700 yards, Fields the only one over 800, with 1143 yards
 - Fields and Allen are the only two over 6 ypc, Allen with 6.15 and Fields with a staggering 7.14 ypc - Mahomes and Jones are both around 5.9 ypc 
 - Hurts was the only QB 1 over 10 rushing tds with 13, Fields with 8, Allen and Jones had 7, and the rest were 5 or less

**Takeaways:**
 - A QB in contention to be a number one should be putting up around 350-400 passes, 550-650 attempts, 4000-4400 yards, and 25-30 passing tds
 - Justin Herbert was a fringe QB 1 despite injuries to himself and the rest of his supporting cast, probably a good buy for his price
 - Daniel Jones looks like a steal for his price
   - Great rushing numbers, but passing numbers are a lost less frightening than that of Fields
 - Fields is the biggest outlier - need to look at Lamar's stats, but suspect he's similar to that MVP season (which doesn't seem sustainable...)
   - Is the rushing sustainable?
   - Will DJ Moore help his passing numbers?
   - Will increased weapons diminish his rushing numbers (where most of his value comes from)
   - Highest risk, highest upside???
 - Hurts is Fields on steroids more or less
   - Probably will benefit from stronger opponents, as he will have to play longer this season
   - Good buy
